# Citizens NLU Dataset
The above json file contains the data for NLU Tutorial - Citizens NLU (a dataset towards building a multilingual NLU for Citizen Services). The dataset has been curated by NeuralSpace.

## Motivation behind this tutorial:
Citizen services refer to the essential services provided by organizations to general citizens. In this case, we focus on important services like FIR, Blood/Platelets Donation, and Coronavirus-related queries. 

Such services may not be needed regularly by any particular city but when needed are of utmost importance, and in general, the needs for such services are prevalent every day.

Despite the importance of citizen services, linguistically rich countries like India are still far behind in delivering such essential needs to the citizens with absolute ease. The best services currently available do not exist in various low-resource languages that are native to different groups of people. This challenge aims to make government services more efficient, responsive, and customer-friendly.

As our computing resources and modeling capabilities grow, so does our potential to support our citizens by delivering a far superior customer experience. Equipping a Citizen services bot with the ability to converse in Vernacular languages would make them accessible to a vast group of people for whom English is not a language of choice, but for who are increasingly turning to digital platforms and interfaces for a wide range of needs and wants. 

## Statistics about the Dataset
A key component of any chatbot system is the NLU pipeline for Intent classification and Named Entity Recognition. This primarily enables any chatbot to perform various tasks at ease. A fully functional multilingual chatbot needs to be able to decipher the language, understand exactly what the user wants.

This diverse dataset contains samples in 8 languages namely English, Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, Gujarati, Marathi, Punjabi and Bengali. The number of intents (for now) are 6 which are InquiryOfLocation, RaiseMissingPersonFIR, StatusOfFIR, InquiryOfMissingVehicle, InquiryOfTiming and RaiseCyberCrimeFIR. We aim to add more soon. Currently, this dataset supports 15 different entities as well.
