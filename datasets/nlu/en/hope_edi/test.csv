0,Also in my country female students are better than male students in every lesson. It's not because they are less than girls
1,@kennedy mensah Saying Black Lives Matter implies that most people think that black lives don't matter and that's just insulting. And where is your evidence that cops go around killing blacks for no reason? Where is your evidence of institutionalised racism? Look up the crime statistics if you want to know why so many blacks are being killed by the police.

1,Saying any life matters more than another is racist
1,@BJK how exactly?

1,Black people sold black people to white people. They showed white people how to manage slaves.. Learn your history
1,@LSmoove 79 My white privilege? I used to live in South Africa and I dealt with racism their and the police here were MORE corrupt. Don't say I'm white privilege when I went through that.

1,@Pancho Mulongeni She redefined being ladylike??  I don't think so.

1,Chloe Deehan just make it abuse. It fails to convert anybody anyways
1,@Dus Bus Still this slogan sound rasist. No one cares what do you have on your mind by saying this. The main thing how does it sounds. What if I gonna stand in front of group of black people somewhere in dark street and start to shout out loud white lives matters. More likely I gonna be killed.

1,random person at the comments nif its racist to say all lives matter
0,With so many people thinking that they are God's. If that were true than why don't they see that God looks at everyone with pure love and he filled our world with wonders that all people need to experience like the healing power's of all he created. If all lives matter than we will all prosper as it should be. When only one race matters it is doomed to fail because to actually be a true success all lives unite to combat what's wrong.
1,All Lives Matter came as a response to hearing [ONLY] Black Lives Mater when it is meant to be read Black Lives Matter [ALSO]; so saying it is merely a way to show opposition. Using this phrasing of words has been done for some time in modern English

1,Here’s ya asexual
1,@Ed Jessup It's cute that you think her stance on LGBT somehow comes from a place of purity when she's done whatever outlandish means it has taken her to stay in the public eye. She isn't doing it to be a good person. She's doing it for attention. Grow up and stop idolizing fallable humans.

So.......white lives or if I was Indian or Asian or whatever represented if they die they don’t. Matter ????
1,The 1k who disliked this are paid off by Soros and the rich white men that all the BLM donations go towards. Go to BLM webpage and go to donations . It takes you to ActBlue and shows the amount given to rich white men. 186 MILLION TO BIDEN

1,This video is surreal now that we’ve had the test of time to expose what the purpose of All Lives Matter was really about all along.
1,@Dus Bus Please educate yourself and join the BLM to fight for what's right yeaaaa please educate yourself and learn that the BLM movement is extremely racist itself

1,This is the most admirable thing I've seen from these protestors. Better tearing down statues of slave traders than rioting and looting.
1,What type of  nation that has statues made of people who used to sell slaves. I wonder if there is statues of lawmakers who made the age of consent in 1823 as 12 for girls and 14 for men.
1,@Mustafa Sharif they're basically throwing a temper tantrum instead of solving the problem themselves. Sorry tried going into details but YouTube censored my comment and deleted it. It's best to ignore the news and look around YouTube for the real news. The news only cares about chess.

1,SHE LOOKS LIKE SHE HAD A GOOD CRY 5 MIN AGO...
1,@xBrownskinAngelx your not talking to openminded people debating a subject objectively they  already made up their minds about black people its a lost cause. Its sad because of closet racism your white friends could be posting hate like this and you would never know.

1,@Samer Angallo Because it creates division and to say silence is violence is even worse because it creates an enemy where there isn't one. BLM are being played and the victim mentality people like you adopt is being used to manipulate all of you.

1,“That would just be uh pure mean” omg she’s so sweet
1,Sheriff Clarke nailed it by identifying the LBJ presidency as the starting point of the decline of the black community in America. They happily signed up for Johnson's Great Society and began losing their self-respect by selling their soul to the Democratic Party. It has created generation after generation of an attitude of victim-hood and subsequent dependence on the federal government. The Democratic message is

1,Saddam would of shot these protesters simple as that
1,They basically stood by and did nothing. They were worried about public safety and just writing them up even more than they already were. We’ve all seen how these idiots have been acting right now. It would’ve been unwise to jump into the situation and having the protesters unfairly attacking the police again. They will inevitably though have to get round to fishing it out of the river though. Unlike what the protesters seem to think

1,Because All lives matter isn’t used as a push for all lives actually mattering they are simply anti BLM and it isn’t black vs white we know this. It’s against the police system that fucks blacks in the ass and has been for generations. The reason why we say BLM is because cops kill blacks and get out scot free as if their lives don’t matter. nnnnIt’s not blacks against whitesnIt’s about fixing the racist police

1,2000tc88 i think you should definitely read into what the phrase black lives matter really means. i feel like a lot of people are misinterpreting it. obviously all lives matter but currently black lives are not being treated as equals. maybe you see past a person’s skin color but so many people in this world don’t. the goal is for black lives to be treated equal

0,@TheCounterpointer Funny. Typical misogynist. You say feminists are stupid for thinking there's discrimination against women in stem fields just because women make up such minority but then use the same statistics to make a point how women being minority in some fields means they're biologically inferior or not capable of doing something and you just assume men are better at everything.So hilarious and sexist

1,It’s true.  Cruelty is cruelty.  You can’t be selective. You can’t change people
0,I know  there is some sexism in the workforce and there is no doubt about that. But the thing that i hate is that these people are basically saying with all these stupid percentages that men need to change and help women into engineering and men are the problem that there aren't really any women in that field. And that is completely wrong the main reason that there aren't any women in engineering is because women just don't choose to go into that line of work. it's as simple as that.

Look her up. A complete incompetent Feminist who pulled the gender card during the dying days of her Govt. She literally jump the shark trying to emulate Obama with her Women for Gillard campaign. She was thrown out by her own party BEFORE Australian people could vote her out.nnHave a good look at how Clinton handled being Secretary of State.

1,MrMojoman1236 Black Lives Matter does NOT include ALL Black Lives. Just the handful killed by racist cops who come in all colors. Hypocrites.
1,Its time to call these protests and riots for what they have become.nA far left socialist uprising. nnThis was never simply about so called police brutality and systemic racism. nGroups like Antifa are pushing an agenda which threatens the stability and prosperity of our society. nDo not forget these are the people that follow an ideology which has impoverished and killed many millions of people in Communist/Socialist controlled societies around the world over the last century. nUltimately they do not serve the best interests of the poor. They simply hate the rich.nGiven the opportunity they will not think twice about turning their Nations into failed welfare States in order to achieve their objectives. nnIt's time to call them out

His only directive to conquered nations was to free all slaves. No monetary compensation was given to the slave owners for their losses.nHe then told conquered nations that they could choose to stay a part of his empire or rule themselves. Under the condition that they kept up with his no slavery directive. Otherwise he would conquer them again in order to free thier slaves.n2

0,+Jonathan Mason I could also agree on one thing agree to disagree because no matter how many ways someone says something I'm always going to think all lives matter because we're all lives matter means is you matter other personal matters the world matters nobody should be treated like they don't matter when it comes down to it it's all about ethics In fairness at the end of the day isn't that racisms weakness let me tell you this it's not just about me it's about everyone including yourself you should have a right be treated fairly and I don't have anything against you just saying I believe the answer to getting rid of racism fairness caring about everyone no matter what their color is everybody's life matters including you I care about even what's fair your side my side their side because I don't like racism I rather be a solution to the problem then sit there and tell people but only my life matters when in reality that's a bunch of baloney it doesn't matter what color you are your life matters and you're important as anybody else how could that be a bad thing

1,@karennIf you do not uphold the Christian values
1,Saying Black Lives Matter is a shout of rebellion against the fact that black lives are not being TREATED as though they mattered.  And that is certainly true. While All Lives Matter is certainly the better way to think and live (and I would support it more than any other approach)
1,The girl that wasn’t accepting of homosexuality is giving a bad rep. Presbyterians are some of the most accepting people I’ve met and there’s plenty of people in both of the Presbyterian churches I’ve attended and they’ve widely accepted before they became members or started attending.

1,most of them won't because of criminal background. im talking about all nationality's here. there is police brutality but it ain't nearly as bad as people make it out to be. they should be held accountable for wrongful actions but then there are even video's of activist dealing with police training scenario's and they shoot just as fast. it's hypocrisy.
0,Ik I thought she would get emotional because they would be able to relate.... but then again sometimes it takes a long time to come to terms with the “weird” feelings you feel so she may be repressing them... there’s a lot of discomfort on her face throughout the video and honestly I think she fears someone is going to “drag her out of the closet”. Growing up I dealt with that same kind of fear not because my family wouldn’t accept me because I knew they would but I was scared I wouldn’t accept me... idek if that made sense but overall she could just be fighting this internal battle that her true self hasn’t fully won yet
1,Aren’t you all American
1,to these politicians and the the big banks  and corporations that back them NO LIVES MATTER. It is twisted the black race in stating that only black lives matter are making racism worse. In the eyes of God the Father all lives matter.

1,Slavery existed in Africa thousands of years before any white man set foot on its shore but in American schools the only slavery you are taught about is the transatlantic slave trade. About every ethnicity that exist was at one time involved in slavery. In America this is the generation of entitlement and victimhood. The crown of victimhood is worn with great pride by those who never experienced any form of slavery
1,@gamerxj To many people Chinese lives don't matter either after Cov-19. Is it any better to say Chinese lives matter?

0,I’m a Christian but I agree and support homosexuality and the LGBTQ community. I understand that everyone is different and is free to believe in what they want but if you are against homosexuality because of the bible then simply think of how God would much prefer you to spread kindness than hate. At the end of the day if you don’t agree with it then simply keep it to yourself and think before you spread hate! ‍

1,@night light   The Egyptian indigenous are Not the Egyptian of today . The true ancient Egypt is a tribal called Nubian. They're still largely present in the southern Egyptian  valley.  They're black basically as Egypt is already geographical located in African. Morocco. Tunisia.algeria and Libya were all black once upon a time. However they're still black citizens  in those countries  but live in countrysides. Modern Egyptian falsified the Egyptian history of nubian but many know the fact. Go to Google and time Nubian.

1,No they should not be removed. The meaning of the statues will have changed over the generations. Some like the one pulled down represented orginally the good he did for Bristol. The statue became known more recently as  a sign of repression. Now the statue has gone the struggle will have been forgotten. The statue had served a purpose.
0,Ashton Levry I get what you're saying but at the same time why should they defend people that we say all lives matter if we're all created equal shouldn't there be all right for us to say all lives matter because honestly I think we do matter we all matter but even if you're what you're saying is true then it shouldn't hurt your feelings that we say all lives matter no offense

1,Haitch Smith but to say you won’t say black lives matter because you were bullied as a kid is ludicrous. You’re condemning an entire racial group just because a few black kids bullied you. I’m sure they weren’t the greatest people but that’s to say everyone in your racial group are evil and should be punished accordingly. Makes no sense
1,Police are gutless. Hampered by years of Political correctness. They need to get the batons out and get on top of these thugs. Can't believe they stood back and watched this happen. Pathetic.

1,@Drew Saluk It doesn't say that. The Bible already gives extramarital affairs the thumbs-down elsewhere. There's no need to mention the homosexual angle if that were the case.

1,the liberal promise of autonomy is empty

1,@GamerXP3 the minute you mention white privilege is the minute your credibility dies. That's an ad hominem attack to demean white people and make our accomplishments essentially worthless. It's an excuse. A fallacy. The black community won't change until they take responsibility for their own actions. The community wont change until they stop blaming white people for all of their problems. I don't want to hear about privilege coming from minorities considering they get to live illegally here and get hand outs because they don't want to work. It's a logical fallacy.

0,Let's make some mental gymnastics (it will require a LOT of it) in order to assume homosexuality can be cured. Done ? Ok. How are you going to cure someone by hitting them and make them repeat the same thing over and over again on a daily basis ? This is no therapy. There's nothing therapeutic in being hurt or brainwashed. How do we still call those... things therapies ? This is nothing more than legal abuse. Parents who send their child there would say i'm sending my child in a place where they will be abused both mentally and physically if they were honest about themselves. Then add the usual I love them and see if it makes sense.

1,ah i'm in tears. he's such a strong person for always being unapologetically himself
1,@Molly Rebekah You don't know what I know about the Bible or religion in general. Paul never met Jesus and if Jesus ever wanted to say anything about homosexuality he could said it himself if it was important. Through his own teachings and even his sermon on the mount Jesus spoke about many topics. Homosexuality was never a topic. The closest he ever got to speaking on sexuality was with his discussion about marriage where he talked about Eunuchs in Matthew 19
1,If you're black you can say white lives doesn't matter and nobody will say anything and it is not considered racist but if a white says all lives matter it's racism..... I don't get today's society I really don't. And yes ALL LIVES MATTER.

You can't find a human that can design another grown human the way God designed us. So if a human doesn't have the ability to make a human body then only someone of a higher intelligence could have done it. God created this world and the proof is all around us. How can you prove He's not real? This is a new account btw
1,@mya kahlo Don't tell me some b.s. like if you're not with us you're against us nnYeah I don't see BLM as the solution.nmy solutions literally have a different goal than what BLM is about so why would I empower them?nnWhy would you speak out about BLM if it's not even relevant as you've stated yourself? lol BLM doesn't have to be your savior.

1,@Dus Bus I simply disagree. Affirmative action gives privilege to color people. What I see here in America - as a person who moved here from outside and has unbiased opinion - people of color have all necessary means for success. So
1,All lives don't matter until Black lives matter. We are drawing attention to a big issue in our community.
0,Tapiokapuddin It just means that you don’t consider it okay but you don’t care if others do and you still accept and respect them. It’s kind of like saying you don’t agree with like a politician and what they stand for or something but you don’t hate or frown upon anyone who does. That’s all.

1,Because you are a butthurt society?????
1,They protest because the rights of peoples were ignored. But what they did was illegal as well. Those criminals aren't better than the police men. To tear the statue down it needs a decision of a court or a parlament. I want these destructive anti- democratics punished as well as those murderous cops.

1,@JJ souls and I forgive ur ignorance. You aren't as evolved as higher intelligence people.
1,I find it amusing that Bernie Sanders to saying black lives matter but in 50 years of government service he has done nothing for black lives matter and Hillary Clinton who has multiple times insulted the black race is now all about Black lives matter. 50 years of government corruption........but it's somehow trumps fault.

1,@Winston WindsornProfessors can still embarrass students regardless of law--just because it's a rule doesn't mean that everyone follows it. Professors are also people and can succumb to weeding out students whom they believe to be misplaced.n    Professors in each of the schools I've attended have singled out students

1,Tha Waterman that’s a whole lie when people say ALL lives matter black people get mad because they say that just to suppress black lives matter
1,Comments like this are just priceless
1,Why doesn't Black Lives Matter protest the wars. 57 percent of the U.S. federal budget wasted on the military. That is what Martin Luther King protested and today the industrial military is far more extreme. Kids in the U.S. are forced to join the military out of desperation which is a form of economic slavery. This extreme hording of Tax dollars is why their is a lack of funding for social services

1,@JustPerson uh why?
0,What i dont like about this interview is that she doesn't own being a heterosexual who supports the LGBTQ community. She is straight- children and all. But maybe she believes love is love. n.............. Either way lots of straight people liked her music as well. I wish all people the best. All lives matter.

1,@Morgan Taylor No. I will defend myself one million time if needed and those who get attacked because of the same opinion.
1,@Samuel Stephens LOL!!! Yet again interpretation IS individual interpretation. I'm sorry but you cannot even use Leviticus if you are Christian for you if not the other passages about eating pork and mixing fabrics. Oh right!! You still want to use the ones that are convenient for you. Lying with man is an English translation and it could be talking about pederasty or religiously unclean

1,@Oradixie Galloway truth! And we really dont even hear what they are learning in schools
1,The police brutality myth is a total lie. Statistics prove caucasians are MORE likely to die in the extremely rare brutality incidents. The media is LYING and attempting to make whites and Trump look bad to ensure they win the presidency to keep the corrupt real plantation owners in power. You are being played.

Do not get me wrong i trully believe in ALL LIVES MATTER Wow that sheriff is one badass;-)

1,I don't think anyone in this country is doing as much to hurt the black community as much as the dope man. He funnels money out of the poor communities and sends it to Mexican drug cartel's.nWhat's the difference in  working for the Donald Trump's and making them rich or the drug cartel's? You go to jail with the cartel you go home with Trump. Myself I rather keep the money in my community and stay at my house at night.

If your going to the Bible it’s says “a man who shall lay with a woman shall no do with a man” but that part is mistranslated. Man was actually Boy which is referring to pedos. Also you gotta kinda remember the Bible was not written by god it was written by men who claimed to have met god.

So there is no other choice but agree to say black lives matter in less you want to be labeled as a bad person.🤔  You want people to support a movement that agrees with a organization that the person is against 🤔. I'm not white but I have to say All Lives Matter even the ones that BLM doesn't support.

0,I actually agree with her when she said it’s a cultural problem. There are countries where girls have a hard time being in STEM  and countries where they are mostly completely fine. I personally grew up going to a math and physics based lyceum that was super hard to get into and we had about 5 or 6 boys  in a class of 30 people. We had a blast and our gender  was never an issue. I don’t know if it would be the same if we weren’t a majority but all the girls went on to become engineers
1,How dumb can these protesters be

1,Shayotita I understand and have seen this response plenty of times. Those crimes unfortunately are often only brought up in mainstream media as a counter point which I find disheartening. In my town meetings and day to day conversations it’s a prominent topic. I agree that it must absolutely be addressed more and dealt with. I suppose news outlets don’t find the topic profitable so it’s left out only to be used in a divisive manner.

0,How can you be  surprised that people are surprised that you are an engineer in the same video that unbiased shows that only 10% of engineers are females?nnThat means that your colleges are right to ask you if you are one of those mythological unicorns. There is literally 90% chance you're not.nnAlso you want more female engineers? Good. Me too. Society too. Don't preach to men how they're not reacting well to you on the off chance you are an engineer. Preach to young girls how engineering is cool
1,​@Everything EVERYTHING!! Ironic how black people had encouraged the slave trade during it's golden ages.

0,@Fate Kyougo I never said or implied that I was better than anyone. My commment was just to show that women can be anything they want to be. Don't assume things.
1,Aside from all the stereotypes
1,Here's my question. Why do black or most black people hate All Lives Matter? Could it be that black folks in america don't give a crap about any other race but their own? Wasn't the black people from Africa the real slave owners and slave traders of their own kind? Do they ever protest if the cop was black instead of white or some other race?

1,I used to live in a shared house with a family who would take in foreign students. One student was from Saudi Arabia and he was amazed that women were allowed to walk around with no hijab on. A female student asked him to go for a drink and he actually went back to the family he was staying with and asked them Is this allowed in your country? Is this OK? because it's not allowed in Saudi Arabia. So you can't possibly equate Islam to feminism.

1,@Soul-Ring Games It doesn't matter if she didn't say it literally. She implied that just because it happened to her it might happen to Annie (which might literally not happen). People have to just respect her opinion and I can see a lot of people here don't.
1,So is your face! That's why you don't have a profile picture.
1,My opinion...Black LIves Matter is both a phrase as well as a political organization founded by three community activists with a socialist agenda. When you say black lives matter you may believe you are simply supporting a slogan but you are also empowering the leftest organization of that name. According to White House records the organizers were coordinating and meeting with the Obama Administration in the aftermath of Ferguson as the group was being founded and are closely aligned with the Democratic Party. It is clever strategy to use what sounds like a well meaning slogan as the name for a political organization with a much larger agenda.

1,@jazzfan1 Are you really going to tell me that white privilege takes the same form in Oregon as it does in Louisiana? Are you really that disconnected from reality? White privilege is not a blanket concept that works the same way everywhere the way you and the rest of BLM want to make it seem. If you can't even narrow in on what institutions are actually causing problems then you have no hope of ever fixing them.

Someone in another country does an atrosity and we end up with people crowding our local town scaring people and spreading the virus and potentially killing people by doing so.  It's like pent up lock down syndrome... . Please think of other ways to show us your views. I am white and might not get exactly what you mean or misunderstand. How about having an mp who just does black rights  in the uk.  The NHS etc have enough to do right now with riaki g there lives against the virs... Which includes black and white staff at risk.

1,I would fire each one of these woman anybody who whines and complains like this needs to be fired you will make excuses every time crap doesn't go your way everyone has to prove themselves in engineering and a lot of feels like that because you do not get a free pass just because you've had success you have to prove yourself each time that goes for men older people younger people woman groups and individuals anyone can fall out of favor and anyone can succeed over others if people look at you a certain way when you walk in a room probably because you are a big whiny complainer and they know they're going to have to deal with your BS constantly whining about this and that that has nothing to do with the work if affirmative action was gone tomorrow these people would be the first on the chopping block they make office spaces work environments and team groups in hospitable towards each other because everyone has to step around eggshells with them end of demoralizing the and the whole office atmosphere

Because black people supported them when the lgbt community were fighting for their rights. Why do you think us Hispanics part of the BLM because black people helped us when that disgusting punk called trump put CHILDREN IN CAGES. We’re all equal but racist cops don’t understand that.

1,When people say all lives matters its derogatory to the black lives movement this movement stand for the political injustice that black people face just walking down the streets dresses in a suspicious manner. So when you say all lives matter you make it as though all lives face this same issue. Naturally all lives matter is that even a question. But the problem here is when you say all lives matter you indirectly denounce the problems faced by victims of racist police brutality by also indirectly implying that all lives face this problem

1,These Drive-By forums are not worth a whole lot...all make some valid points
1,Jens “it seems racist”....you have many people just in this comment section alone claiming it is racist. Whether you agree with them or not there are people offended by it. Now you’re telling me it’s deliberate and designed to be provocative to get people talking...you can’t see the hypocrisy here? nI get they want to be heard and feel like they haven’t been treated as equals but the message should always be equality. It should always be about bringing everyone together and making them realise we are all the same regardless of skin colour. Nobody should be made to feel racially attacked or victimised in a movement to stop that very thing happening. n“So why should they pander to white comfort and preach a slogan that keeps white people in that comfort space” again it’s comments like this that implies all white people are the problem here which simply isn’t true. You can’t fight racism while attacking an entire group of people based on their skin colour

1,Someone says all lives matter and people say you don't get it. But I think THEY are the ones who don't get it. People who say All lives matter are trying to discourage the mindset that race matters at all. Instead of focusing on the race of people
1,CaptinOD and no one talks about black on black and black on white crime.
1,@Robert Morrison I think I phrased it wrong in the sense that I never played with Lego’s. I’ve seen it

1,@Sister Sidney the reason the civil rights movement was so powerful was because people were protesting like civilized people not running around lighting stuff on fire acting like fools. That why this is a joke. Black lives do matter for sure I'm all for that statement but people are saying black lives matter but are using the statement to do ignorant things. Maybe it would be taken more serious if people acted like adults and not children.

1,@Tom Comiskey I don't feel like we need reparations. We lost a war. Part of my tribes treaty is that there will be peace as long as we don't have a standing military force. It happened in the past and I feel like it turned out better than ot could have since most losing nations are the ones that have to pay reparations after wars. Now if the U.S. broke up and there was a war again or with another tribe then I would think the winners would get the spoils.

1,Y'all act like you are so woke in the comments but are reinforcing the stereotypical archetype of a lesbian by saying Annie looks like one. You cannot tell someone's sexuality by their appearance. All masculine girls are not lesbians and if you walked up to an actual lesbian and told them they look like they like girls they'd probably be offended. The irony of attacking someone for homophobia while being homophobic yourself.

No mention of the white cop that died the same way bc democrats use this to gain votes media pushing an agenda . Not one of them there would know what racism was if it but them on the hind in. If one thing happens they think it's happened to them all. We forget about white slaves. And even though some confederate generals fought to abolish slavery. Democrats do not like facts.

0,Ill be honest this speech did not inspire me. She made it seem like they don't encourage women to do well in engineering. As a Chemical Engineering student I have been nothing but supported by teachers and other classmates in my program to succeed and do well. The STEM field wants more women in the field... women just don't choose to be in the field. The majority of women want to be in other careers like teaching or business. Most of the girls that I have talked to ask me why I would want to be into a major like this. It's not a problem of women not being encouraged to be in engineering

I think god would rather accept the people who show love to everyone and dont think that something a person is born with is a sin or crime. Just saying. Just love everyone who isnt anyone.
1,@Serhiy Vereshchak statistics say the opposite...
0,Jessica Walker - “not agreeing” still isn’t the right context. Not LIKING makes more sense. When you say you don’t “agree” with something it’s as if you’re responding to someone who wants your permission or is asking for your permission to be themselves. You not liking something because of the hate that’s been imbedded inside you via a book where a man walks on water and snakes talk is YOUR personal issue.
1,Most white people just will never be able to understand why black people do what they do.nnI don't if it is due to a lack of empathy or they just don't care.

You loved him/her with all your heart and you would do anything show your love as a father/mother. How could you even think twice about sending them away for loving somebody?

Cities like LA and NYC have promised to cut funding of police departments and presumably invest in low income neighborhoods. So saying tht BLM isn’t helping in regards to police reform is ignorant.

1,its all lives matter to say black lives matter is racist. racism does know color to begin with. recently if ppl look on utube. a black cop beat up a Hispanic guy that couldnt speak english. it is the reverse racism in the country. white cops are considered racist rite off the bat. but does the music industry do anything about in hip hop song the use of the N word no but if it was a white rapper then it would be racist.

1,There was no All lives matter movement before the Black lives matter movement. Saying all lives matter exists with the sole function of being a counter argument or distraction to civil rights issues. Obviously the police and a large percentage of white people do not actually believe that all lives matter. All lives matter quite specifically exists and ONLY exists to oppose the statement that black people matter. How is this hard to comprehend? Do the doctors refuse you  care when you're injured because all patients matter?

1,You are fools. The constitution says all men are equal but was that true. The constitution had to change over generations to free the slaves and then with civil rights laws. If all lives matter why are amendments needed? All lives donot matter.
1,I agree
0,I think we should collectively agree to not label this as therapy. This is not therapeutic at all. This is abuse. Covering it up with a medical term when its not even medical in nature  (hitting someone with a book is physical abuse/repeating verses meant to break your will for hours a day is mental abuse) is disrespectful to the field of medicine which serves to help and cure people. Gayness does not to be cured. It is not a disease. It is not a choice. There is absolutely nothing wrong with it. Now lets respect one another and help stop this abuse.

1,@dragonflywhisp Checked off a while ago? What bubble are you living in? LGBT people get attacked publicly at twice the rate any other American minority group does; it's gotten much worse than it was ten years ago. And this is ONLY American statistics. There are countless countries where it's punishable by prison or death.nThere's a fine line between being a professional victim and sticking your head in the sand and pretending all the bad things are over now. Although I know that's what a lot of people want to do. The gays got that one thing

0,Tank S. It’s not about what’s wrong with playing with Barbie dolls. She’s trying to emphasize on how girls are trained / expected to not go into the STEM field. How people think that girls aren’t smart enough for it although facts say the opposite.
1,For sure. i can almost guarantee this year will be taught in history classes
1,@SCIIMiwabl you don't think it's coincidence at all that George floyed was black and the cop was white that all the proof you have though a white man killed a black man that's not racist yes it's wrong but who the hell said it was racist he was not screaming racial slurs while kneeling into his neck tbh we will never know if it was racist or not

1,Because there is an agenda here...the Democrats are using racism and BLM to cause race divide in this country to try and win the election and BLM
1,Also many black lives are taken each year by white people but people protest only if they see it in a video or someone else tells him about it

1,@Vladimir Putin I respect your feelings 100%
1,I just do not understand why people don't realize that she's a top witch Satanist and all of her videos and everything and so much of what she does totally is obvious and prove that and she's just part of the new world order to brainwash people for the agenda for the transgender agenda for all that stuff cuz she actually is transgender and people need to do their research cuz her recent show she just did was completely Satanist New World Order shows the end time stuff and people really need to watch who they worship and look up to because people worship this woman and she's a Satan worshipper
1,She lost me at her claim about engineers ...solving things like global warming...nKind of difficult to solve a problem that occurs naturally in the cosmos.
1,perhaps it is controversial because it misses the point when another black person is killed over something very minor by the police. if they were to protest with signs saying all lives matter

0,I dont understand why it is up to anyone else but yourself to make the decision to become an engineer or whatever. The great thing about america or any other nation that is similar is that if you work hard you can accomplish pretty much anything you set your mind to. Obviously you need to network and some luck but saying you need to get more diversity just to get more diversity is absurd. I dont care who the engineer that helps make my bridge

1,@Astute Cingulus it's what's happening today why I don't support BLM. They make it all about skin color. At first it starts peaceful but then there's destruction and nothing but pointing fingers. Google Tony Timpa. He was a innocent schizophrenic white man calling the police for help. White officers killed him. Because it was white on white you didn't see it everywhere you go. Not even on the news.

Oh I forgot FOX didn't want you to know that. nnOh you might want to know the Trump Foundation was shut down by regulators. Trump was using the money for himself.

1,Where did the Sheriff go?? We need him back...🤷‍
1,BLM was founded as a reaction to UNPUNISHED police abuses and historic targeting and escalation of force used on black and brown people. nAll Lives Matter is a 'what about' red herring fallacy to deflect to conversation away from the complaint. If you 'what about' an argument

0,I wanna be an engineer but I suck at math. But I like chemistry and physics...
1,My own personal view of this is the statue was a reminder of what should not of happened in history ... so should of been left as an embarrassing reminder.  Also the obvious many people there in the crowds are going to catch covid and maybe die ..... so not only will they get ill or die but some poor NHS worker (from whatever ethnic background) will have to look after them and risk there own life doing so ...
1,shut up he an industry plant! stay woke
1,@kris c sin? Gurllllll. Everyone sins
1,Just look at what is happening now
1,@mya kahlo hahaha your whole argument fell apart. You can't hold BLM accountable for what some protesters say in the heat of a protest. The Dallas shootings were an isolated incident. The BLM does not condone violence nor does it hate police officers. nice to see you've admitted you're against it when you've been dismissing it the whole time. Also your profile picture and linked google account shows you're a white male so I have trouble believing anything you say at all. Nice to see you also like to victim blame and that basically black people should just deal with racism because the world is not out to get them when it so blatantly is. Colorblind racism at its finest.nnKeep liking your own comments though. It probably makes you feel better.
1,I feel bad for laughing about him getting beaten by a bible
1,@*Vibes in queer* You can't be a lesbian and a Christian at the same time. It's contradictory. I'm sure you read all the comments I did before this one. But whatever yoi believe. 🤷‍

1,It's good to see a comment like this here. I hope there will be more 'meet half way' comments in the future.
1,I saw a guy making a jet engine. or a mad scientist with a new type of something unlimited power. lol
1,What still shocks me is that Democrats like Nancy Pelosi and Joe Biden use black culture constantly for votes and recognition. Nancy wore a traditional African tribal scarf to “relate and stand with the BLM movement” even though Africa has absolutely nothing to do with the BLM movement or American system
1,@ImGiodarex how is it not?

1,Man I’m black and I disagree with black lives matter. But I think all lives matter man.
1,@Molly Rebekah You mean disapprove with acts of homosexuality. Homosexuals exists
1,Its amazing that this video is from 2016 and look how history repeats itself. Its almost like these are not organic movements but political puppets brought out only when an election year happens too stoke conflict and division. Go look at who funds BLM. George Soros and now even China is backing them with millions of dollars which gets funneled through Actblue and goes straight too fund DNC candidiates.

1,Who’s watching this during the George Floyd protests?
1,That’s sad to say because there are people in many other countries who care about the movement. But antiblackness exist everywhere not just in the U.S and there are communities who need to address that within their own communities

0,Tenacious Tacosnthere tends to be this antagonism towards women stating their point of view because it is automatically viewed as misandrist and discriminatory against men when paradigms like sexism and racism are not symmetrical because of the historical precedents where one group has been favored more than another. These scholarship initiatives are merely attempts to balance an unbalanced game. Not to take from opportunities that were already there- supplement not supplant. There's enough to go around

0,I find it funny at the amount of attention the lack of female engineers gets while ignoring that females are outperforming males in every aspect of school BESIDES engineering.

1,@Harrypotter Hum people of all races are invited to participate with open arms and they do. Contentions with blm based entirely off the slogan name blm is racist in and of itself. Saying a particular races lives matter should not feel your heart with hatred.

0,To say black lives matter is to say that one race is worth more than another. Racism in its basic form is the belief that one race is better than or more superior. You put a color on what matters and you are racist. BLM is just another attempt at political prostitutes trying to find new Johns.

You can't even say  All Lives Matter without being called a racist or facing backlash. I mean it's so obvious to see that other groups are using BLM as a front for their own agendas and narratives. The woke ones know what's going on.

1,Just not understanding why black folks look to white people to solve all their problems. Isn't that a formnof racism. Why can't they solve their own problems using the court systems and the hundreds of organizations that have been set up and funded to help them. Will they always take the victim posture.

1,Trayvon Martin was sacrificed by his Masonic parents. Wow they’re really something aren’t they? nBLM is a marxists group designed to divide Americans by race. nThis is a direct result of America foreign policy and how we treat other countries. No wonder they are trying to divide America. After all we have done to other nations. nWhich leads me to my next statement. The Us government is incompetent and should be taken over by the people. America’s government does not represent the people.

1,@BackYardTV How could white owned land in SA be stolen land? That's racist to think that blacks own the whole continent of Africa. It would be like Europe or North America confiscating all the black owned property
1,Clearly not when that video is full of them.
0,So human lives matter would be a good slogan to fight for.
1,No you’re missing the point. When a black life is taking there is no consequence to the police. When a white man takes a white man’s life the life matters when a black man takes a black male life the wife matters when an agent man takes an Asian man life the life matters. But when you have cops killing black people regularly on camera and getting away with it. You tend to believe black lives don’t matter. Because if it was white people in those situations it would never have had happened. So then you have to ask yourself do black lives matter to the American government and the judicial system. The answer is no! Do all lives matter yes of course that’s been established. Now let’s talk about the lies that are being taken by the people who are supposed to protect us. Stop avoiding the point. I can’t even believe they talking about in all lives matter debate versus a black lives matter debate. The day you see all lies being treated the way black people has been treated then we will have it all lives matter debate.

1,@Denise Farias It's been a long time since I've written that comment and I've looked into this topic and I agree with you.

1,@DragyTD People are reaching. Not once did anyone say 'ONLY black people lives matter' but when you're talking about stuff like 'Save the Turtles' people don't automatically assume that those that say it are saying that we should save ONLY turtles. People just don't want black people to have things to themselves. All the time we are expected to share our stuff. So people can stop lying about 'it implies that only black lives matter'. When SE Asians were being discriminated against in the UK and America not ONCE did someone say ALM and not once did people mention the struggles that people of other races go through UNTIL people said BLM. They didn't care before

0,There are only two sexes (and also intersex people so technically three sexes) but gender identity is up to the person. It’s a very western idea that there are only two genders and many other cultures believe differently and have believed differently for thousands of years. If a person wants to express their gender as something non binary to boy and girl they should have the freedom to do so. If they aren’t hurting anyone else why make them change into something they aren’t comfortable with

1,But can you name all the police officers that died in the line of duty by getting killed by shines like George
0,It's not about black lives. It's all about the tactics of intimidation by the police that sometimes escalates a situation and will lead to excessive force and generally due to the lack of cooperation by the suspect. When one's freedom is at stake one's instincts will lead to defending that Liberty and often times this is precipitated by the police officer allowing his emotions to get the best of him. It doesn't matter what race you are what matters is

0,As someone who dosnt really feel comfortable saying “I’m religious” but would say my beliefs fall most closely to Christianity and attends church regularly... this whole concept of conversation therapy disgusts me. I have read the Bible through and through. Yes the Bible does say that homosexual actions are sinful. It also says a thousand other things are sinful (things we are all guilty off in our lifetime) the Bible clearly says all sin is forgivable. The Bible says the greatest commandment is love. Jesus when faced with the option to condemn chose love over and over and over again. He forgave and he showed compassion. In fact the only people Jesus was super blunt or “mean” with. Was not the drunkerds

1,@Forest Gump in 200 years time if it turns out that society finds the practice of making computers abhorrent for reasons that we don't understand today should we tear down statues of tech company executives who donated large sums of money to charity. Do people like Bill and Melinda Gates become cannon fodder to history? No we appreciate their kind work in the standards of their time. Honestly put some donation boxes on the statue and donate the funds to a slavery museum like the one in Liverpool. History is done. Nobody expects the vikings the pay back for the monasteries they burned or monks they enslaved. People that unfairly discriminate their fellow man today against modern values or argue that the slave trade was good today are the menace

1,+C K  i get what your saying. but if people came along and said all animals matter they would happily agree but then remind them that the rhinos need more attention. they wouldnt go all ape shit and call them names and say they dont care about rhinos. you have to agree this shit is out of hand.

1,Anyone care to guess how many police officers are killed by blacks every year?
0,Saying Black Lives Matter doesn't mean Screw everyone else who isn't black. Why don't White Americans get that?nThe fact that a group of people have to stand in protest and practically scream Hey! We deserve the right to life! because of the recent publicly exposed police brutality should be the concern here. Saying All lives matter is unnecessary and is doing an injustice to Black Americans. If all lives truly mattered then Black Lives Matter wouldn't be a movement so necessary today
1,​@themooch Your life does not matter. Sorry.
1,I think it's time to look in the mirror instead of looking at us. I've never owned a slave nor has anyone besides people in Libya. Obama killed the man that was going to free them. If black lives really mattered those slaves in Libya would be free. But gold was more important. That and Obama's role in knocking off countries for the cabal.
1,@Jun3 Shiroyuki oh really so the officer who put his knee of Flyod's neck would've done it to a white guy when this officer has a record of being racist and killing minorities
1,I am so happy and proud to live in the same time
1,It's also ironic that this is the south west of England which had a major problem of the (white) locals being enslaved and taken to Africa. Both clearly abhorrent sides of the same historical problem but not isolated to white skin colour by any means.

1,ALL LIVES MATTER bottom line because the U.S. is formed by all races nthe key problem in U.S. its because Police officers will use force against you if you resist an arrest that's when this contraversial misunderstanding errupts especially with black communities and latino communities this should had not happen if you STOP! resisting an arrest or resisting a detention resisting a search warrant that's what so contraversial because a police officer always use excessive force when they feel life threatening no matter your color of your skin resisting an arrest to a police officer in front of a camera is a serious offense and black people and colored people don't want to reconized it because they use the 5th amendment to battle challenge against police officers profile intreview an individual that are trying to do their job

1,Wolfie it does not make us alt right for saying that these people just keep complaining. this is why trump won. we are fed up with people creating problems out of nothing
1,A prime indication of intellectual weakness and moral ineptitude. A deadly combination. And it's overtaken the whole sum of the entire non-conservative portion of the US

1,I definitely thought the girl in the burgundy sweater was LGBTQ+....just say’n?
0,She said it bothers her that people call her smart when she wanted to be pretty. I had the exact opposite complaint at that age - I wanted to be called smart instead of pretty. I am a Roboticist today with an extensive background in both software and hardware. I have friends who's parents encouraged them to go into STEM that hated the idea and felt pressured
1,David and Larry Rock!

1,Not white people when they have all the privilege
0,Is it true if you'll take engineering you must be good in drawing?? nAnd I want to take engineering and my weakness is drawing
1,@Molly Cone also you basicaly said you would talk to the person and tell them they are a sin because of their sexuality... How about let them live their life because how they feel does not hurt or effect you in any way. Also you seem to assume very quickly.
1,@Angel Carson  You can look through the comments to see why I don't agree. But I don't agree with it because God

0,I love that you guys are coming at this from a full heart and really trying to help children understand the new world that they live in today some people may be against us some people may be for it but whether you’re against learning about the way the world actually works or not doesn’t mean that the world doesn’t still actually work and if your children are going to be productive people in our society then they should learn about our new society

1,@Steph’s Manic Shenanigans but why does it matter? Are we really that concerned over it? We shouldn't be.
1,@Aaron Rashid I have the same interests. How old are you? Because if you are like 14

1,I second that
0,I hate the “I don’t agree with homosexuality” argument like??? That’s like saying “I don’t agree with that tree over there. Like??? It’s just a thing that exists and can’t be changed
1,@rgw1380rw lol you didn't even know what the word slander meant. You said I ignored nothing.
1,All people getting abused by the police but the media only covers African American majority of the time to cause racial tension amongst people when it is not necessary police abuse everyone the only way this world can get better is unity amongst people we have to put race color creed and religion behind us to improve the future of the world there's only one race the human race the good must stick together and get rid of the bad that's thats what it boils down to it's available color its about Good vs evil good and evil is all over this world it has to be separated

1,I know she doesn't want a boy because I'm the manager of that lol
1,Floyd died from heart problems with 90% blockage in one artery and 75% in another.  Floyd was a career criminal who already spent 7 years in jail mostly from home invasion with a gun put to a pregnant woman's stomach while his mob went through the woman's home stealing all her possessions.    Floyd feared going back to jail for his forgery scheme and the stress caused heart failure.  Floyd got his justice even though it should have been much earlier.  (Go to the Stefan Molyneux channel for a good video about Floyd).

1,I thought EXACTLY  THE SAME THING!!!!!!
1,Please take them all!
0,The fact a lot of people become famous and forget who helped them become famous and Madonna did not! She basically saying the lgbtq helped me become me and in return I’m forever in there “debt.” (In a good way) and I will never forget that and will All ways help out. It’s not just saying okay I support the lgbtq it’s acutely doing something on a daily and not just during pride and Madonna shows that and she helped us as we helped her and that’s amazing!!!
0,If so many people hate racism
1,Madonna is seriously repulsive-looking to me. She has a bird-like

1,Classic troll - don't feed this DB
1,Hey- a lot of the people you may be thinking of did nothing against the law. You might not be aware about a kid foot instance called Elijah McClain who was going to the store and had the cops called as he was looking suspicious. Look up the story. Or other people who were just going home. I know people stopped constantly in their own car. On the way to work. In their Worker's Uniform. You know better now than to make a blanket statement like this.
1,They thought it's cool to protest.
1,For this reason God gave them up to dishonorable passions. For their women exchanged natural relations for those that are contrary to nature; 27 and the men likewise gave up natural relations with women and were consumed with passion for one another
1,@Bbm add#11 Nobody has mentioned killing babies in this thread. Not even once. Maybe you're referring to abortion
1,Chlopakzpolski I’m so sorry if I offended anyone
1,@chris chris Same with whites..racism is Not about Supremacy it's about Ignorance.
1,@Anna ._. sorry but why?? nothing really wrong with this statement other than it could've been phrased better. to a kid
1,She is a sell out to the beast system. Money fame all came as she sold her soul. She has been a big supporter and promoter of sinister life style. This is how you stay on the top
1,@Molly Rebekah no offense but I don't think God disagrees with it

1,all human lives matter...lets not use colors ...
0,The problems is that one doesn't negate the other.  If All Lives Matter then what is the problem with saying Black Lives Matter or Blue Lives Matter? They are a part of the All am I correct?  Not like when the constitution said We hold these truths to be self-evident
1,@p jay people have the freedom of religion so we are still going to believe this true and historical accurate book talking about our lord and savior Jesus Christ

1,For news men
1,yeah it's called good surgeons
1,All lives matter suggests that all lives already matter today to everyone. That racism is not happening at all in America. That is what Black lives matter has issues with. Black lives matter today means
1,Same except im still Presbyterian and havent come out yet lmao

1,Only victim asian
0,All Lives Matter!! Follow the laws and be productive citizens in society then your life will matter otherwise you put your life in danger and it will not matter.
1,It is not a celebration these days. It's a historical reminder
1,Sherriff Clark is da man
1,MrCosmin94 and your statement “opening” people’s minds is completely invalid when you yourself have no prior knowledge to a actual topic. And making a point as bland as “who created god “ is like asking which universe created the universe. Because from a naturalistic view there has to be a natural non divine explanation. And based on the Laws of thermodynamics energy can’t just appear and disappear but be constant. So when you take nothing and create an infinite expanding universe with finite energy that is always constant and never created or taken away you come to question how that energy got there in the first place? It is the reasonable human reaction. So to tell people who have found peace in an answer for themselves makes you someone that can’t stand others happiness or comfortability. You would think being a human being you would have more compassion towards others and their own choices. Like I don’t judge you for yours
1,@TheLegend27 Is Alive I'm glad that you agree and stuff
1,@Healthcare Matters How's that??
1,Black lives matter claims they are being oppressed and their children os being denied a education.
1,@Rigo Batiancila That's where you're a bit wrong like Ashton Kutcher said yes all lives matter but to some racist people black lives don't matter when it should matter here! Therefore BLM is not a disgrace here!
1,bro i swear to god that girl radiates super bi vibes. cuffs her jeans

1,I am shocked that sth like that even exists. Honestly
1,When people boo when said that All Lives Matter
0,Conversion therapy has the same origins as ABA. Autistic children are exposed to abuse regularly with the goal of making them outwardly act less autistic.
1,He doesn't even have a legacy because everyone will forget about this time where all the people that rioted looked themselves in the mirror and say to themselves I am an idiot
1,@Eric it all started with tryvon who zimmerman was found guilty but they thought since it was a black kid it must of been racist.
1,@Daniel Franco you are right. I just found that a funny coincidence and had to point it out.
1,His dna is 100%. He (madonno) has a bad disguise of woman. In the 80's the trans-doctors were not very good.
1,Both alternatives are right when it comes to /pol though
1,@Steve Cole wth
1,stuff like this is why I stay away from organized religionnnnMy main beliefs are Pantheism
1,A lot of people complaining about her being a nasty feminist who's complaining about nothing
1,I'm starting to think the black people are becoming racist..
1,You are a deplorable idiot if you don't think Black Live Matters.
1,Yep the only reason why these politicians are supporting the      “BLM” is to get more votes and support from these anger civilian.
0,thanks for encouraging me to fight with dignity once again... appreciation to the tips and real life facts... Respect!
0,All lives do matter! To say otherwise creates separation. We are one Nation under God. We all bleed red. The human race is the only race. It's time to move forward together. We all struggle and have struggled.
1,They shun the straight kid lowkey

1,They question woman bc woman usually aren’t in those fields that’s like seeing a guy with a group of babysitter of course you’d question the guy also men’s brains are better for engineering
0,My choice is to love perfect answer because God is Love so that's why the gospel needs to be spread through  testimonies and exposing the false churches that the devil comes in the name of. 2 Thessalonians 2
1,@Heather So how is her baby kicking any different than a woman in the slums of Africa whos baby is kicking? Put that before The Lord God Almighty.

1,@Khaver Paver that was 50 years ago bruh.
1,@Corinne Mcmahon what AGENDA are you talking about? Tolerance? Peace and letting people be who they are instead of FORCING your views on others?
1,I didn't know this was 4 years ago. I thought this was recent.
1,I think the girl who thought homosexuality is a choice is a lesbian.

1,Raphael Taylor nThanks
1,Corvus Corax Also
1,Fark that slave trader statue.
1,This video is so pointless.nThe women themselves look bored as shit and provide no proper facts or incidences within their working environments that prove Silicon Valley institutions are sexist.nThe fact that there are way less females in this employment sector is NOT sexist. It just shows that women tend to choose other jobs over technical and engineering ones. Anyways
1,When they say
1,that's the spirit i love
1,Historic Moment my arse.  Just a bunch of pathetic morons
1,@Flora Fauna It's this shitty game they play with all stigmatized minorities. Talking about oppression pisses off bigots

1,Bea Millan-Windorski Love how you assume being talked down to is exclusive to women...sexist.
1,leo A I agree with u on that & it’s always Politics when Dems act stupid Election time
0,Being pro-life and pro-sterilization is not hypocritical. nnBasically you can believe that a mother shouldn't get herself pregnant AND believe that if she does get herself pregnant that she shouldn't be allowed to murder her kid.nnThis is no stranger than pro-life people advocating abstinence. They're not trying to make sure women have babies; they just don't approve of murdering children.
1,How is that soft butch homophobic
1,And I’ll talk to you like an adult. If I get stabbed in my femoral artery and blood is gushing out it’s not fair to look at me and look at someone with a Papercut and say that you’ll help the person with the paper cut first(Papercut is white bleeding out of your femoral artery is every other person). It’s not saying that you don’t have a problem it’s saying that our problem is way worse than yours.
1,No...lol It could be just someone who disagreed with lgbt+ that’s what I told my mom
0,Jens I’m not offended by black lives matter. The first comment in this topic was about how the slogan was racist. I went on to say that I don’t think it’s racist but I had my concerns how it could be causing a divide and doing more harm than good . nA good number of the comments on here say it’s racist so clearly some people have an issue with it
1,There literally is no right side to BLM it doesnt matter what side you're on. You're always going to be wrong in someone's eyes.
0,I was an engineer and starting to be an 8th grade math teacher just this year at 53.
1,George Floyd was a criminal who unfortunately lost his life due to a legal police hold while he resisted arrest (as he had just committed fraud and had a history of crime) with NO racist intentions. The 4 officers who assisted to hold him down were 1 black 1 Asian and 2 white officers. How is this racist????? Loony left agenda to control the west.
1,I cackled
1,Saves the council from having to remove it

1,She seems relaxed and genuine here - nice to see
1,The irony of this being recommended to me
1,@Big Radford we should of left them shackled to the hull!! And let the slave masters whip them. Enoch powell was right about letting them in. The saddest this is!! We gave them equality free healthcare free benerfit system free housing and they still want more!! And now we white supremacists.
1,Protection gains to HIV<<<US CODE COLLECION par 51 section 1122.germwarfare .began
1,Overturning the statues... The terrorists of isis overturning the Sumerian Statues.. It is not freedom to erase testimonies of a past... Because someone does not like it.. It is not civil but it is extremism and dictatorships.. Where is Democracy.. In vandalism and hatred for the different.
1,@you are totally right
1,Black lives do matter and anyone who says different need to go put some duck tape over their mouths! And other lives matter to but we need to work at one thing first then go to the next if we go out and say this life matters and starts a whole protest it will get out of control we should take it one at a time.
1,ALL lives matter period.  I am surprised i never saw this article till now.
1,Black Lives Mater Agenda....whats your thoughts?
1,Bot gonna lie but the BLM movement is the biggest racist thing I've ever seen (aside from slavery). I don't know about you guys but I saw one human being unjustly kill another human being. So shouldn't it be human lives matter
1,@Whatsgoingoninmycrib History is written by the winners it is never the truth
1,I like how this video
1,U cant justify or compare slavery with religion u need to stop talking about prizms and start thinking out of the box
1,You’d think the statue wouldn’t have even made it to the pavement without the local authority’s getting involved
1,BLM was created for the division of race. A genuine good person would have made a movement called ALL LIVES MATTER. Knowing the system is messed up and all races are subjected to police brutality. If ALM was spoken

1,if i have enough money and resources i've already done it myself.
1,@Johnathan nostar Um...Jesus did exist
1,God gave us a choice
1,Can we stop with this idiotic argument? People are saying Black Lives Matter because they think black lives are oppressed and they should be pumped up to the same level as other lives. It's wrong but that's what they think. End of argument. Can we now focus on all the traitors to this country? Like the governor of Seattle letting an autonomous community spring up in front of his eyes? Or the victimhood mentality that is damaging MOST youth? It's a whole generation poisoned by leftist ideology. Hope they find a path in their lives and that they somehow develop a skill and a career. If not
1,She looks so beautiful
1,Bruh people have been racist to eachother for centuries. You can't let racism happen and it's not like people from the past cared that much about it.
1,I want to know why Blacks always bring up Slavery and never Mention that it was Blacks that sold them into Slavery? George Floyd should not be Memorialized as Victim of Race. He was a Drug Dealer/Druggie and a Multi-Convicted Felon. His Career of Crime started when he was 16 years old. He was no Dr. Martin Luther King.
1,You just made a stereotype comment. Just because a person has short hair or seems queer or whatever
1,Urban_ Rose wait it didn’t post?

1,@Anesu Nambware I see you did not bother to mention anything about the WHITE woman that was murdered. I find the statement BLACK lives matter Offensive and RACIST towards me as It should have said ALL lives matter. The FACT you have to bring up MLK from over 50 yrs ago shows you still live in the past. I have always taken people at face value regardless of their skin colour but to try and rewrite history by pulling monuments down and wanting to get rid of things like the confederate flag and ban tv shows and movies is going to the extreme in my opinion. History is important as we should try and learn from it.

I am not familiar with law in USA but in my country if you officialy announce demonstration or parade or any public action like that and they aprove it (which they always do unless you are asking for something really silly) then any group blocking you during it will get removed by police quite swiftly. Why it was not like this in this case?

0,Sadly it is being put as a trend. But black people are still suffering and they are downplaying us and trying to shut us up.nWe just want racial equality and to defund the police. It seems they are doing everything but that. But we shouldn’t use this important movement to turn attention to something else that isn’t the matter at hand. We will fight for equality then we will spread out to those regions too. They are all equally as important but we have to stay focused. I hope you understand this.

1,Another Cultural Marxist.  IF she is really an engineer what has she done?  Maybe the fact that women are more interested in advocacy and groupthink is why we shouldn't waste time training them.  Reminds me of that other Jewish woman agitating for more women in video games.  I guess gender doesn't matter....unless you can agitated for women?   This is more mushy thinkiing.  Things can only get better with a female perspective?  So are we going to ACKNOWLEDGE MEN AND WOMEN ARE DIFFERENT?  YES OR NO?  You Cultural Marxists can't keep up with your own lies.  Ted is pretty much trash now.

Also Anyone Who has a Counter Protest like All Lives Matter are a Racist or Bigot because they don't care how many (Unarmed) (unjustly) Black people are being killed so once White privilege is Taken away ND White Supremacy we will have peace.

Someone fighting cancer will survive if god wants them to or die if god wants them to and sometimes they will throw the devil here and there in the equation . I have no faith in god yet I'm healthy and happy but many of my family members who go to church everyday are ill

The slogan means business and was made to generate discussion.

Female math geniuses are usually stronger in other subjects as well. Like I said before

1,@natalie bogle The only issue with racing this country is people convinced that there's a problem in making one and then the people that have nothing to say and they don't know what to do about life it gives them something to get rallied up and worked up about and then you get people that are antagonizers that know how to work people up like the organizers of that organization are admitted train Marxists they're trained to be able to rally people and get them worked up they admit it in videos figure that one out so it kind of like takes the narrative they created a narrative to push their agenda a false narrative to rally people to push this agenda

And quote me where I said black lives matter most that one actually kinda pisses me off its hypocritical to say that.

1,Watched this again 4 years later in 2020.  Same old crap.  Sorry we missed Sheriff Clarke in Kenosha.  Protestors against police in Milwaukee bringing young childre to the event..how will that shape children's perception of police officers as they grow up?  And a photographer stated that police show up aggressively.....well...wouldn't you be stressed out and on guard when people are calling for your harm?  I don't know if we can come back from this.

1,@Brian Driscoll I doubt anyone became an engineer due the moon landings dude
1,The level  of ignorance Michael brown attack a police officer and try to get his gun!!!!
1,Mmmm. I would disagree. Religion is belief if you believe something hard enough it stops becoming a choice. People in soviet Russia were brainwashed to make them love Stalin. They couldn’t make an active choice to deny it because that’s the way they perceived the world around them. It’s like seeing a green apple and trying to convince yourself it’s not green. It’s almost impossible because that’s how you see it. If a religious person sees homosexuality as wrong and believe it enough it becomes less of a choice and more of  a perception of the environment around them.
1,So at this time. And for a long time. Black and brown are abused and murdered at a high rate. So it’s nothing wrong with accentuated and pointing out the obvious.  What about statistics ?

1,Can you please do a video on the fact that if God made a man and a woman(2 people) then their children would have to have to reproduce with their parents or their siblings. I am pretty sure that somewhere in the Bible it says this is wrong. At least this is wrong by current law so by creating Adam and eve God was encouraging them to break at least moral law

1,@***** The movement began in reaction to the deluge of unarmed black victims of police (and wanna-be police) violence in the news recently. To get your panties all bunched up about the name is irrational. If you want to start a movement you can call it whatever you want.

1,Why is this so boring
1,This black man just said if a white man said “white lives matter” it wouldn’t be racist. He’s only saying it’s ok rhetorically because it gives him the right to say black lives matter in real life. If a white person actually said white lives matter they would be killed by a blm mob.

1,@Angela Naday - They find it hard to understand because people in general prefer to be led around by the nose and think whatever the political correctness of the day instructs them to think. I doubt most people even remember what racism really means anymore - it seems to have turned into a big stick that political correctness whacks anyone who fails to fall in line.

This isn't racism its just common sense. nStay home

1,Someone coined a term to bring light to an issue. However others want to change the term that ends up deflecting the purpose of the term.  Cause we are trying to make you focus on lives that others don't think matter which is black lives.

What is wrong with religious people to condemn something that is neither bad or unnatural. The profess to be the religion of love yet are so hateful and intolerant.

This autistic dhiarea can be only swallowed by regressive cucklords. Fuck you Wired for trying to forcefeed us this regurgitated PC identity politics. Fuck you and good bye.
1,It's funny but they did not complain about it when we let them in. All those blacks would not want to come to Britain if this country was poor. This country is rich because of our past empire.

In most cases it was a kingdom against another kingdom. There was no such thing as Pan Africanism back then. Even Europeans didn't see each other as all the same until quite recently.

1,@Johnathan nostar Psalms chapter 24 VERSE 1.
1,@Iroor I never interpreted what you said as if you were saying the slogan needed changing.nI was merely emphasising the utter hypocrisy and intolerance on issues pertaining specifically to race. Why does Alm as a slogan have no relevancy to blue lives matter? This indicates to me a fundamental bias. You also overlooked my issue with all lives matter as it relates to counter protests against blm.
1,Poor lives matter. That's the true root of the issue.

1,That’s a ridiculously stupid conclusion to come to. Just sayin’. It IS against  God’s Law but we can speak against it and still love people and not put them through this torture. The equilibrium is possible contrary to popular belief.
1,Saying  All lives matter in response to Black lives matter is kind of ignorant almost a smart mouthed response. If a child told his mother I'm hungry and she responded Everyone gets hungry it undermines the child's point. The child didn't say everyone doesn't get hungry he was just bringing attention to his current hunger. In fact he's agreeing with her
1,I think that the girl who doesn’t agree with The LGBTQ+ community clearly doesn’t know enough about the subject to have a real opinion... my guess was that she was raised this way cause she didn’t really know who to describe why or how she disagreed. Just a thought

1,It's hurting when people like the sheriff talking like that coz he feels white after making it to the whites club
1,The only thing I find a little sad about this is that even when women show an interest in engineering. It seems in America and the UK there is no interest or acknowledgement of shop floor engineering everyone seems to think its design work what ever field it is when she said engineer what ever happened to a man/woman in overalls hunched over a machine actually creating what they have designed

0,@Kurt Sandberg if you are saying that in response to BLM then let me give you a lesson. The reason black lives matter started was because we want all lives to matter. Saying all lives matter is just being selfish and wanting to not feel like the bad guy. Because whites aren't bad

0,I'm a straight Christian female from a religious family and our mindset has always been that just because I don't agree with your choice does not mean i'm gonna hate you for it (it's like hating someone because theyre a different raligion).

1,That's the difference between the average person and the researcher/analyst/scientist. The average person would look at that and take it at face-value then leave it that. The analyst would say hmmm I wonder why that is? There must be a reason or a cause for that to happen then they go do extensive research to figure it out & almost always the answer goes much deeper than just the simple oh it must be because they don't like it. Don't downplay the human psyche. Things are not always black and white.
1,White Lives Matter! White lives have been depreciated throughout decades. Whites are called racists because of skin color. Who wants to start a movement and march? We will accept all nationalities that will help honor white color. Don’t cause a white out! White privilege matters!!

When the speaker said that they were on 5 female students in the class...I remembered those days when we were also 5 girls and no excuses on all of our classes and demos. I am now 36 years old.

0,Because being straight is the norm and people assume that everybody is straight. Because a lot of people are homophobic you grow up hating yourself and being fearful to say who you truly are.
0,Think about it this way by only saying black lives matter you are putting down every other race including Native Americans. They have it every bad because they got pushed out of their homes where their beliefs are so their basically taking a page out of Hitler’s book and say that Black is the master race when that isn’t true because there is no master race everyone should be equal.

1,That sheriff is a strong man with his independent view on things. Much respect.
1,Why don't they just say 'Black Lives Matter Too'. Then at least the 'Too' suggests they're like others without highlighting purely one colour.
1,@CRYxBABY It's because it's universally understood that white lives already matter. nCurrently the evidence shows that black lives are not as much of a priority as white lives. 🤷‍nnSystematic racism.

1,I am so glad this dude is no longer a sherriff...that I know. This is the guy that agrees with the knee on the neck which departments use nationwide. All ya have to do is watch LIVE PD...oh yea they pulled one of the most transparent police shows EVER! Every cop on LIVE PD is a very good one. I will say that Police use the knee to the neck ALL the time so let's not say this is a isolated incident. People have had problems with the knee to the neck restraint for a long time. Now we see why. The worst thing about David Clark is his uniform. All that flash ain't authorized and if it is...well then shame on the me!
0,That's horrible and inexcusable to do to another human being even more so a child! Whether a person agrees with homosexuality or not DOES NOT give them the right to play God and judge another on their sexual preferences. I believe in reading the Bible and showing love and acceptance in one another and focus on verses such as John 8

1,We will think differently after watching this video >>>
1,xXX_ DANKITY_DOGE _XXx Who said there was a controversy? What evidence are you speaking to because I don't think it's controversial at all! What's note worthy is the use of all lives matter as a response to Black Lives Matter! If you can't say that Black Lives Matter can you truly believe that all lives matter? Vice president Mike Pence was asked by a journalist can you say the words Black Lives Matter & he refused
1,Yooo kid. I don’t think you understand. Blacks were brought over here hundreds of years ago to be forced to work in shitty conditions. Our ancestors put their blood

1,@Dat Boi david dorn is the cop. I need to find the name of white guy that got killed though. David dorn was protecting a atore for looters when he got killed. He was an ex captian for the police
1,and the opposite of that is that men doesn't talk about issues and let them linger. and the problems become deeper and deeper. im talking generally here offcourse.  You 50 years late with this diatribe. precisely the reason the original feminism had to appear.
1,The thing is nobody really said white lives don’t matter
1,I'm all in for equality but I think what the future holds for USA is akin to the aftermath of Nazi rule in Germany. The German government is now very apologetic to the Jews. People (Whites) maybe will become very sensitive to slight a black person? According to me
1,Police shouldn't bother.  They should go after rapists

1,Its controversial because Its used as an excuse when they get caught jumping someone in the subway for their wallet and cell phone.
1,Thank you to everyone taking part in the BLM movement- even if it's just listening. nnThis movement is not for a selfish cause. Black people are being penalized and executed and we desperately need your help to stop the bleeding. nNo one is asking for a handout. We simply want justice and fairness for all race. nnThank you!
1,Would it matter if books burned? We can copy the pages or transfer the information into a online format. Technically we don’t even need books anymore
1,@Grizzly Bear  Trump has God in his heart but his actions speak louder then what's in his heart. Masters beat their slaves with a Bible in one hand and a whip in the other. God has been used for evil purposes because the mind of man is weak and easily deceived. Your statement suggests to me that you have been deceived.

1,You said it yourself. doing something negative over another race is racist Too many black people unarmed have died from cops compared to how many black people live in the US. This with the other factors show that black lives do not matter to alot of people. BLM saying BLM is a cry out to be noticed. People wanting racial equality would not have to say anything if it was already equal.
1,she seems very genuine and emotional here. i feel like i’ve not seen this side of her in forever. so much love
1,Republicans are so dysfunctional lol
0,All lives matter and frankly from what I've seen is that gun laws in America are yet again the true problem whether out of prejudice towards the colour of skin I think it's ludicrous the chances between the rich and poor are divided and that is where the true issue is it is difficult to get rid on one bigoted billionaire that so happens to be the president of the United States but laws around the world have no difficulties ridding poor people out of the society so therefore I'm afraid that the majority is playing a dangerous game of racial anger that can result in a civil war that would not be beneficial for whatever colour of skin you've put your bets on so when I say all lives matter I mean to say

1,Vanesa people aren’t making him into the great person to exist. He’s just an example of police brutality. And his death is so noticeable because he even told the officers that he can’t breathe. They aren’t just talking about him they are many other people others are talking about. And I get that he was a criminal but we don’t need to focus on that because that doesn’t mean he had to die when his death had nothing to do with what happened 5 years ago. If trump supporters can ignore the fact that trumps a racist and a rapist I think we can ignore what crimes George did five years ago.
1,I really want people to stop using religion as an excuse for ignorance

1,@Jason Devon Unfortunately the traditional definitions of right and left in politics have been completely distorted by the leftist 'woke' agenda. By traditional standards I would consider my political views to be slightly left of centre - for instance I'm in favour of universal healthcare and a compassionate welfare state. But by today's 'woke' standards I'd be branded as far right because I don't think transgender women should be allowed to compete in women's sport and I think this 'non-binary' stuff is attention seeking bullshit.

1,@Jose Luis statistics wise yes more White people are killed by Cops then black people.   But Also Statistics Wise more (Unarmed) Black people are killed by Cops there's a Difference.   Also Anyone Who has a Counter Protest like All Lives Matter are a Racist or Bigot because they don't care how many (Unarmed) (unjustly) Black people are being killed so once White privilege is Taken away ND White Supremacy we will have peace.

1,They still have conversion therapy in some private schools down in the south
0,As a Christian conversion therapy should be on a voluntary basis and should be closely regulated and meet the guidelines human rights. All these tactics are causing more trauma for the child/individual and not representative of true Christians. Minors should not be sent to these camps
1,An ideology of victimhood with a list of grievances that do not exist. What a perfect statement with perfect timing!
1,@Molly Cone nac i sey
1,That shit happens everyday dumbass. You just don't hear about it. OBVIOUSLY
0,@Molly Rebekah Girl I'm Christian too and you are waaaaaaaaaaaaay outta line. What I'm taught from the bible and what I see it saying is that we should love all. Do you believe that God loves each and every one of us cause that's what we are taught as Christians that he loves everyone of us. So the fact you think God doesn't like LGBTQ people is misinformed because God loves all of us not just some of us ALL of us.nnIt's people like you that give us Christians a bad name because you want to make your own version of life where God only likes what you think and that's what you tell people. When in fact God loves all of us and wants us to love eachother like we want to be loved.  So before you come here claiming to be Christian go and rethink everything you think and read up on what God teaches us. nnnLike girl bye.

1,@EseKanayo2 No duh. You obviously missed the point of my argument.
1,That sheriff has more testosterone than the Fire Lord
1,The reason that All Lives Matter has become an offensive statement is because that phrase only originated to counteract the Black Lives Matter movement. The All Lives Matter phrase was never popularized until Black Lives Matter became a strong force in the country.
1,Lol we'd probably be killed

1,@Indiana Rose nWhilst I hear what youre saying..the good thing about Christianity(not to be confused with hateful American evangelism) is that it evolves..through time..scientific discovery and public debate..you know we now no longer believe the earth is flat or execute people for working on the Sabbath...now we take our advice on sexuality from experts called sexologists...not bronze age dessert tribesmen who knew nothing about the complexities and diversified of human sexuality..in the UK senior clergy are calling for some now deceased homosexuals to receive recognition and award for their good works that benefited society.
1,Jesus Christ man the amount of butt hurt you are letting off is enough to power a small Africa country. Let it go bro you only look more stupid as you keep arguing.

0,@Aaron Lehman So it would be ok for a group of all-white people to walk around with banners that say 'White lives matter' and shout it out to all black people?......white people die too...and we know it's sad and enraging and emotional but we can't afford to seperate ourselves like that...seperation and segregation IS racism......don't fight racism by being racist...just be Human. All lives matter.

1,@MudkipMadness this is all about politics  Those who are destroying the cities and burning them down are fulfilling an agenda
1,GameRoll nHaven't you noticed that people do the same thing for all their fallen heroes and dearly departed?   The best time for cold analysis of a person's life is probably NOT shortly after he/she has gone.  Also people have a tendency to make IDOLS of the dead when it is politically or otherwise convenient.  We cannot blame Mr. Floyd for immoderate comments which others have made about him following his brutal murder.   For it remains a fact that he was murdered.   nnnNow I didn't hear any of these allegations about his behavior before.  It neither surprises me to hear it

1,Its not how REAL CHRISTIAN THERAPY LOOKS...
1,Nothing wrong with the term all live matter. But it's only used because people started using black lives matter. It's used to drown out black lives matter. Not one person screaming all lives matter everytime someone says black lives matter is protesting with black people. Unless they are counter protesting.

1,MultiDarkZen I have no doubt that you think feminism is a hate group. You're just not the first one to say so in the past century and you won't be the last. There's a reason why academics tend to be feminists while uneducated people are not.nnI haven't watched the red pill but from what I read in Wikipedia it's a lot of the arguments I read from YouTube comments that blame class problems on women.

1,@Hippo Bottom Jeans Where? I didn't care that much till you brought it up.
1,If you think that black lives matter means only black lives matter you've shown your own ignorance this movement of black lives matter is a cry out saying black lives matter also... It is sick that a cop would shoot an unarmed or non lethally armed black man. Whites get killed by the cops but 9 times out of ten they were in the wrong the problem is the gross misconduct of excessive jail time and innocent black lives in jail. That's what these people started the black lives matter movement and it's media who have the responsibility to convey the grievances of the people yet you leave us wanting... There are bad protesters and there are bad cops but untill police brotherhood is disbarred and cops work like Walmart employees where they see someone in the wrong they stop it instead of covering it up we're gonna sit here and stew in the wreckage of our ignorance.
1,What a bunch of bull. Lmao do all lives matter or do black lives matter? I can't even believe my ears that that question even had to be put up. Black white Asian middle Eastern East Indian native

1,Stupidest display of bs I hv seen.
1,ok but no one dies during these things
1,Zach Jerde no. Not ‘end of discussion’ calling someone an ‘it’ is the most de-humanising thing you could possibly do and that’s disgusting that you think that’s okay. An ‘it’ is what you call an inanimate object or an unidentifiable creature not a human being.
1,You don't get it do you. Black Lives Matter does not mean white lives don't. It just means Black lives are being treated unfairly by the police and this needs to stop. If there's a burning house you would try to save it and not say no but All Houses Matter... Your house isn't burning... Black people needs the BLM movement to get equality. Stop thinking about just yourself and imagine if you're black. You can get killed by just going for a jog

0,I want you to know that I watched this video when I was ten years old right when it came out. I have never been more grateful for a video. Since I watched this I have changed my entire trajectory. All of my goals and everything I spend my time on is to become an engineer. I am now a Junior in high school and I have been on a robotics team for 5 years. I spend my time teaching other people about engineering and doing outreach events to inspire young kids to go into STEM. I am in a Pre-Engineering program. I created a STEAM event to teach kids how art and STEM are related. I have done all of this because of this single video. All the time and energy that I have put in I did because of this video. Thank you so much you gave me a passion I didn't know I had and it has changed my entire life. I know you won't see this but I feel in debt to you and I needed to thank you.

1,You are ignorant. People don't say white lives don't matter when they say black lives matter. White lives have always mattered and valued more than black lives. To ignore the disproportionate targeting of black people is bizarre. Or maybe you think this society is a happy accident where black people are lesser beings and they made their bed. Saying black lives matter does not mean white lives don't. Saying all lives matter invalidate people that recognize that black people are subjected to racism. If you think black people are subjected to violence the same as whites you are seeing things from a bias that enjoys having power over others.
1,@Jonathan Mason I'm not reading all of that if you can't be bothered to use punctuation. Saying black lives matter does not state or imply that white lives don't matter. If someone stole your car and you went to the police

1,There has never been a question of all lives matter. The fundamental issue is black lives matter the same. This country has never questioned the value of white lives. It has historically undermined the lives of black and brown lives. The movement is questioning systematic racism and trying to bring the country to a balance state by addressing black lives and making our lives matter as well. There is not a black person that doesn't understand all lives matter

0,I could maybe be sympathetic if they were less vague. All I hear is them ascribing sinister motives to people who seem like they are just being overly friendly nerds.nAnd these testimonials right before the statstics on women engineers in Silicon Valley seem to imply that the reason that there are less women in tech there is because it is a hostile environment for women. But step in your typical engineering classroom in America and then tell me that there are as many women interested in engineering as men. A gender inbalance   does not automatically mean discrimination
