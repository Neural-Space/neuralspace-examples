1,I didn't say he does? Your type seem to be so upset by people saying they are triggered that you would make fun of trigger warnings yourselves
0,It's pretty simple. A large portion of the world is anti-gay and the parades are a way to show that gay people aren't going anywhere and demand the same rights that everyone else has.  It's especially useful for the gay teenagers that are put out onto the street by their christian families and feel like they dont belong anywhere. Being able to see that people like you are celebrating and proud of who they are when everyone around you wants to make you feel ashamed for being gay is something that saves lives.nnHope that answer explains part of it
1,Annie is saying she doesn‚Äôt agree with LGBT but you obviously can tell she she is part of the LGBT
1,I hate how that's the thing that people lose their mind about when it comes to Trump! after all the racist and terrible shit he has said it doesn't even matter whether this is anti-Semitic or not.

1,Madonna looks stunning. I also love what she said about michael jackson.
1,@BJGvideos This is exactly what I meant.  He never once said that we need to keep kids sheltered and ignorant
0,Madonna is often criticized and looked down on because she is such a strong advocate for undeserved and neglected populations. It‚Äôs not only due to her provocative nature. I was waiting for Madonna to say that she is sexually fluid and/or bisexual when asked why she is such an advocate for the LGBT community. I‚Äôm not sure if she is or not but always thought she was/is.
1,I say we get rid of all racist tv shows

1,@Raider and why is that great
1,@Jason Aguirre¬†yes. god even said that in the bible. protecting yourself. you think god is a useless weak pacifist?
1,Why do toys have genders attached to them? What defines a toy as being a girl's toy or a boy's toy? A Barbie is no more a girl's toy than anything perceived by the marketing industry or the indoctrinated majority population of society as being a boy's toy. You are right to say there is nothing wrong with it

1,ALL LIVES MATTER.    Stop trying to destroy & rewrite our history. The BLM has become nothing more than a breeding ground for racial hatred.
0,playing with barbies and choosing engineering  is totally fine girls!  electrical engineering came naturally to me i wasn't even worried about being less qualified than guys ! in fact my high school teacher encouraged me to go for it and yes he's a man + I come from a muslim third world country and nobody really cared if I was studying engineering or business or art

1,@Leeloo H Hi I believe I am a pleiadian starseed (meaning I incarnated to the pleiadian star system as well as earth) From my understanding a lot of souls do this with different places but don't remember. There are a lot of videos about this and indigos check them out I think you will like it. It's very interesting
1,This video is stupid

1,Annie gives me a TON of lesbian vibes
1,@Zara Maria Dixon Are you named after the clothing store?
1,All lives matter! God bless America and all lives matter! When you said black lives matter you are selfish and individuals and the issues of life you are asking for. You are just making worst and it will leed to failure results. Please repent and maybe God will hear your petition
1,Ikr.. and something big
1,Dean Smith . Because they don't care about that. They are anti-white racists. That should be becoming obvious.
1,@Unbearable Suffering i guess in this current social climate those will have to be torn down too.
1,+Redblactivist how is Bernie pandering? I don't get it. He's been an activist for black rights as early as the 60s
0,Black Lives Don't Matter any more than Hispanics or Asians or Europeans or Africans or Arabs. Individuals are  responsible for their own words and behavior. There is one race called the human race. So stop race baiting for political agendas!
0,i will never come out as bi to my grandparents because they are very proper and against LGBTQIA+. I came out to my dad and my sister. Im afraid that if i come out to them they will force me to go to conversion therapy

0,I‚Äôll never understand when someone says they ‚Äúdon‚Äôt agree‚Äù with homosexuality. It literally has NOTHING to do with you. There‚Äôs nothing to ‚Äúagree‚Äù with. It just is what it is and always has been.
1,It's not about equality. It's about racist black supremacy.
1,Ford Garcia nobody had to agree to anything! How someone chooses to live their life is entirely their choice. It's nobody's place to say I don't accept that because it's not their life to accept. You can have your opinions and beliefs but nobody asked for them especially when it had nothing to do with an individuals life.
1,@Gennifer Bowen In the spectrum of dumb Karens
1,He got boo'ed for saying all lives matter? How are they not racist for that?
1,Annie‚Äôs sexuality is really no one‚Äôs business. Stop speculating. It‚Äôs difficult enough for anyone to accept their sexuality without having people deciding who you are. nnWhatever or whoever she is
1,All lives will matter when blue lives matter
1,All lives matter is controversial wow what a world we live in and the left say they aren‚Äôt racist
1,She maybe thinks she is caucasian lol
1,that would just be
1,@B a n e probably with them rolled up pants legs but also the heavily religious family definitely made her say what she said.
1,And I honestly mean that. I get we don't agree with each other AT ALL but I still hope you and your family or friends (who ever you celebrate with) have a brilliant day. And also don't eat too much turkey... I learnt from that mistake last year Lol.
1,I like this police officer. He seems well educated. I will vote for you
0,If you want to walk into a room and do not look like an engineer you have to prove it what does that have to do with being a woman? If I walked in and claimed to be a surgeon no one would believe me either. Most things have nothing to do with sexism...nnMany things would not have been possible without female engineers? Why are we ok with that statement
1,If I hear another white supremacy comment I'm voting Trump
1,I'm one of 2 girls in my Applied Engineering class in highschool. Sometimes I worry that other students or even my teacher might look down on me if I ask questions or need help

0,If you're certain of what you want to study just do it! When i was a kid I thought I would be a superhero
1,Destroying lives seems to be the message coming out of this movement because a lot of PEOPLE are dead or devasted by all this crap.nQuit lying to yourself
1,@Dave Rees lol I'm getting tired of typing. what false info tho? Also the idea that everyone within a decentralized movement is going to be perfect is a falsehood. And that stat is a 50 year prediction. Why does that matter to what I'm talking about? when they say minority they mean in the sense of all other races combined. I don't know why that's all of a sudden so bad.
1,What happened to her GRILLz??
0,I just wanted to say to Christians (I am also one)nGod never said to hate anyone he said to love your ‚Äúneighbors‚Äù no matter what.nJust wanted to mention it

1,Amen! Unborn babies lives matters!
1,@Calvinist 1689 ü§£ Don't be so quick to give Trump so much credit. It's not because of Trump that this is happening. This is an end to systematic operation. For people to argue witch oppressor will oppress you the best is foolish. Republicans and Democrats are guilty of racism.

1,@michael bledsoe you know what
1,@Dangus wouzld be great if it was like that but it is an anti√∂-white movement by now and as such going straight against their declared goals. I can't support that hate group anymore than I could support another hate group.

1,Jan Smith People like you call yourself Christians
1,@tom - girl Yes you are right. But it seems like the attempt to help them understand is more of an attempt to make the idea seem appealing to them.
1,@SulttaaniSimo Yeah they do...some people just talk that way
1,Question that should be asked is why was the statue still in place. The protesters did Bristol a favour
1,See that's where y'all get it wrong. It's not about the color of our skin
1,@Yvonne Terran white man Divided us to (Berlin Conference of 1864-1865) learn your history
1,Sea Doggo that might be true. But doubt it. I don‚Äôt dress as a guy bc I wanna look like a guy or be a guy. Been around the block several times in life and that could be a really naive assumption you are making.
1,I dont agree with homosexuality ..... lol who's she kidding?
1,@anonymous one social distancing bruuuuuh
1,Maggie Paul That is not accurate. BLM has been outed as an organization that does not actually care about black lives. They care about anarchy and funding the democrats. All lives do matter and to suggest otherwise is...wait for it...racist (by definition).
0,Mesmerizing....! Bravo! Why no one came up with this earlier! The way we think the world is developing so fast yet it still manages to surprise us with its absurdity is plain staggering. Although I grew up to be an activist after majoring in social studies

1,TheLegend27 Is Alive nnyes.
1,Tbh. Though she does fit the lesbian stereotypes which is why people are going crazy about her . I never seen a straight female dress like that. And she feels uncomfortable to the subject which is what I noticed. But then again I‚Äôm a femme lesbian like a lisptick lesbian. You would see me as a Barbie  doll.
0,That's crazy... People like these who BEAT people with a bible give Christians a bad rap. Christianity means to love people not be even a little bit like this!!! That guy is so strong for being himself
1,You sound dumb Af
1,I think the way that 'developing an interest in science' is marketed actually almost DROVE ME AWAY from science. No
1,And i thought there are stupid people only in my country.
1,will you tell me how BLM has helped raise the black community? what we need is better education. more of a focus on education. we need to lower the single motherhood rates in the black community. both of those factors have been proven to be linked with crime. i think that when we focus on raising raising our community from WITHIN that is truly the only way we can ever fix issues from the outside
0,There are lgbtq persons who do bad things. Thats a given. But that shouldnt be the license to hate everybody else in the lgbtq sphere cause a lot of us are nice and righteous. Generalizing is what needs to go. Ps

0,Of corse all lives matter but thats not the fight right now. The fight is for black lives right now. People who say racism is gone are either blind or stupid. My best friend Joey and I go to conventions all across the east coast to film

When I see Black Lives Matter I am not offended. I don't interpret it as Black Lives Matter More Than Other Lives. Perhaps they should of called themselves Black Lives Matter Too so that the All Lives Matter snowflakes didn't get offended. Who in their right mind would interpret Black Lives Matter as something negative and racist? Perhaps right minded Proud Conservatives.

1,No matter the reasons people have to rebel against a goverment unneccesary violence like looting and defacing statues is more mob mentality. The reason we have invented modern democracy (flawed as it is) is so people could solve disputes with discussion and peacefull assembly. A society where  everyone would have the right to assembly  free speech and  protection t from discrimination would come together vote on people to run the country and set rules (that did not violate the members rights) that governed the country. People who violated these rules or supected to would have a chance to prove they did not do it. Such a society requires peacefull discussion of the matters at hand. In such a society there is no need for rioting

0,Conversion therapy should be illegal! It is totally a violation of people‚Äôs rights and it is physical and mental abuse!
0,That one young woman is not necessarily in the closet. I know many of the viewers on this are quite young and judgemental in a sense. I was also raised in a household with strong beliefs. I think it‚Äôs very incredible that she expressed hers and came on this show. It also shows that her parents are willing to accept her no matter what. She‚Äôs an absolutely beautiful and such an intelligent girl and I truly hope she reads more positive comments. Many of the people commenting are very young

1,Cop pulled me over came to the window and asked for my licence and insurance and to search my car all in the same sentence. I told him he could search it then asked what i did wrong he said what you going to tell me you dont smoke weed. When another officer pulled up and asked why hes searching my car he said he thought it might be stolen after running my information already. If it wasnt for that other cop i would have gone to jail for being black.the cop wasnt following me i drove past him he saw my face and did a u turn in the middle of the street. I left the situation without a ticket.  Hell yeah some are racists.
1,all lives matter only exists as a counterprotest to a protest against racism
1,Yeah! Well there are lives that don‚Äôt matter. The lives that are hidden in a blueprint that only God knows about. But then when their presence becomes obvious then the argument comes in that     there‚Äôs a choice to be made. How valuable is that life? Sadly many times not at all.

1,You don't get it do you. Black Lives Matter does not mean white lives don't. It just means Black lives are being treated unfairly by the police and this needs to stop. If there's a burning house you would try to save it and not say no but All Houses Matter... Your house isn't burning... Black people needs the BLM movement to get equality. Stop thinking about just yourself and imagine if you're black. You can get killed by just going for a jog

0,I stopped watching when I saw Sandra Bland's name given as if she was killed by racism. She committed suicide after being detained for a day for acting like a hysterical crazy person. The police do the same to anyone. Freak out on a cop and you'll spend a night in a jail cell to cool down. Turned out she was crazy enough to kill herself as soon as she could.nnStop black supremacy. Stop hating white people. The US government should treat all citizens the same regardless of race. We don't need a racial apartheid state or caste system or second-class citizens. No race is subhuman. Criminals
1,Wow that's a new one.
1,I‚Äôm really confused why blm is a thing in America considering if you look at the stats more white people get killed by blacks then blacks by whites. Why are people not talking about that ?

1,@t0bias busterud Yes exactly.
1,the black lives matter movement isnt made to say only black lives matter. #blacklivesmatter is to express the importance of black lives that aren't acknowledged. saying all lives matter is belittling the focus of black lives matter. of course every life matters

1,black lives matter this is what the media dosen't show you
0,I think that being a woman has less to do with being interested and capable of being anything traditionally where men excel at. I think personality type differences are a bigger factor in determining that. Institutionalized and gender barriers aside
1,buy a dictionary and look up All then look up racism
1,who remembers that one episode of the boondocks where Martin Luthor King jr. comes back to life and see's what the black community has become and ends up hating blacks
1,The irony is these statues represent life back then and how we have moved on.....problems with racism will still exist with or without statues....try addressing the real problems rather than going for harmless lumps of copper and stone

1,Big Lies Matter... Why didn't the protestors show any mercy for those black officers who lost their lives in the streets during this madness? Because black lives mater only when they can use it to achieve their political goals.
1,I have said over and over that it is o.k.to love both genders. It's having a sexual relationship with the same gender that is a sin. You don't go to hell for loving the same gender
1,Not trying to personally attack you
1,Did your dentist beat you
1,another push to divide everyone just like the pushing of anti-Semitism in the UK's political arena. Voting is pointless as it's likely leaders are selected not elected.

It‚Äôs unfortunate that you‚Äôd draw such a defined line in the sand but that‚Äôs your prerogative to do so. I‚Äôd like to know is violence the only thing you see from the movement? Would you agree that there are some BLM protest that are peaceful from start to finish?

1,@HooverDude 60 What kind of argument is that for anything. WTF? Seriously. Be honest. I am lost on the agreesion. Why the attack on the subject. What is so threatening. The statue lords up a wrong doer to put it politely. Bad deeds are not discounted by other bad deeds because they are in say your percieved opinion

1,all lives dont matter until black lives matter-sure i get your point but NO ONE should get attacked for being racist when saying all lives matter. people gotta use logic
1,Thank You Madonna ‚Ä¶ thank you so much.

1,link for the picture? no? ok cool
1,of course al lives matter. the point of the phrase is that black lives are being treated as expendables by the police and the government that employs them. black lives need our focus right now because the situation has gotten out of control.
1,Jessica Walker that passage was mistranslated...
1,@Steve 30x it is still 2020. I agree nobody should be a legal property of another mane. Slaves were a form of cash at time. Today there is more slavery than ever in a different shape and form. one of them is the low cost market. we think it was design around the poor man in reality is exploiting us. I don't see these statues as a celebration or invitation to slavery. Queens of England knighted pirates back in centuries. Was is it right? Nooo. But it is the past. it is something we are to learn from. symbols are symbols
1,Most women are taking engineer courses because they are so insecure they need mommy and daddy to pick their destiny for them.

They will always wanted to get right.. and if I try to speak my mind in a strong way like they did then suddenly I'm not a gentleman anynmore..

My dad got me a Bob the Builder tool box set and I loved that thing. As I did with the show. I remember seeing those TV ads selling plastic builder/workshop tool sets for boys and always wanting one myself. I would've loved Goldie Blocks if it was around when I was a kid. nnThis video was very inspirational. Intelligent and beautiful woman. Glad she never gave up.

We‚Äôre saying we‚Äôre that kid that fell and hurt his leg. We are saying it takes away from us. So I hoped this help you understand why we feel that saying all lives matter is disrespectful.

1,Major Tom nnI‚Äôm not sure I would ever be able to ‚Äúmake peace‚Äù with such people even if I did take a pill that changed some aspect of my personality for their sake. There‚Äôs something fundamentally flawed about those people that runs deeper than just this one opinion about one thing. It‚Äôs likely the same logic they use to find homosexuality problematic is also running in the background of other judgements they make. It seems to me like the best solution is to bring them to some kind of change or new understanding of the world rather than changing a more superficial feature of other people to appease them. I think that actually moves everyone in the right direction.
1,Because she is often vulgar

They  don't give a fuck about shit...they don't care who dies for their cause
1,They tossed it in the harbor where it belongs

1,@brandonshmandon Pretty sure a lot of it was also due to lockdown protests in the US. Most of the BLM protests are done with a mask one although not everyone keeps distance
1,Jessica S Wish You all the best !!! Talent is grown
1,@Skechy Yeti if someone is subjected to that level of mental and physical amd trauma than the term survivor is warrented. if its applicable to other things as well that shouldnt affect it. people have died as a result of conversion therapy and those who have survived it often deal with ptsd which is very difficult to live with
1,people who are looting are using BLM as a reason to lot. they are opportunists. BLM protests started off as peaceful but police started to teargas and brutalized peaceful protesters.

1,@Jessica Walker That's not true at all. The East is more anti-LGBT than the West and this has nothing to do with any religious doctrine
1,NOXISUM How? The whole statement was created to support people of color saying that all lives matter and we shouldn‚Äôt be killing people on their race I understand that black lives are definitely more in need but I don‚Äôt understand what‚Äôs wrong with the phrase.
