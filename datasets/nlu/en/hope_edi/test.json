And making a point as bland as “who created god “ is like asking which universe created the universe. Because from a naturalistic view there has to be a natural non divine explanation. And based on the Laws of thermodynamics energy can’t just appear and disappear but be constant. So when you take nothing and create an infinite expanding universe with finite energy that is always constant and never created or taken away you come to question how that energy got there in the first place? It is the reasonable human reaction. So to tell people who have found peace in an answer for themselves makes you someone that can’t stand others happiness or comfortability.

The best time for cold analysis of a person's life is probably NOT shortly after he/she has gone.  Also people have a tendency to make IDOLS of the dead when it is politically or otherwise convenient.  We cannot blame Mr. Floyd for immoderate comments which others have made about him following his brutal murder.   For it remains a fact that he was murdered.   nnnNow I didn't hear any of these allegations about his behavior before.  It neither surprises me to hear it",

I spend my time teaching other people about engineering and doing outreach events to inspire young kids to go into STEM. I am in a Pre-Engineering program. I created a STEAM event to teach kids how art and STEM are related. I have done all of this because of this single video. All the time and energy that I have put in I did because of this video.
