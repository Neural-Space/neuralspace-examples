It was only created as a combatant otherwise it wouldn't even exist. No one is blaming white people. We're saying stop killing black people unjustly. That's it. Obviously there are other problems going. Probably more important ones too. But are people not allowed to stand up for themselves without being attacked?

Even train drivers in the US are known as engineers as apart from driving train engines they are expected to know the nitty gritties of their engines as well as troubleshoot engine problems when in operation. What I meant by working with hands (exaggeration) was that skilled engineers are more hands-on with practical experience on shop floor or on site in case of projects. This is precisely why women are misfits in a field like engineering cuz they are dependent mostly on technicians and do not like to take orders from their managers (submissive attitude) due to ego problems.

A black candidate for being a student in the school premise is more sawn after than a person of yellow colour with the same qualifications.
