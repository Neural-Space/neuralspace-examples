It was only created as a combatant otherwise it wouldn't even exist. No one is blaming white people. We're saying stop killing black people unjustly. That's it. Obviously there are other problems going. Probably more important ones too. But are people not allowed to stand up for themselves without being attacked?

Even train drivers in the US are known as engineers as apart from driving train engines they are expected to know the nitty gritties of their engines as well as troubleshoot engine problems when in operation. What I meant by working with hands (exaggeration) was that skilled engineers are more hands-on with practical experience on shop floor or on site in case of projects. This is precisely why women are misfits in a field like engineering cuz they are dependent mostly on technicians and do not like to take orders from their managers (submissive attitude) due to ego problems.

A black candidate for being a student in the school premise is more sawn after than a person of yellow colour with the same qualifications.

And based on the Laws of thermodynamics energy can’t just appear and disappear but be constant. So when you take nothing and create an infinite expanding universe with finite energy that is always constant and never created or taken away you come to question how that energy got there in the first place? It is the reasonable human reaction. So to tell people who have found peace in an answer for themselves makes you someone that can’t stand others happiness or comfortability.

There are bad protesters and there are bad cops but untill police brotherhood is disbarred and cops work like Walmart employees where they see someone in the wrong they stop it instead of covering it up we're gonna sit here and stew in the wreckage of our ignorance.",
