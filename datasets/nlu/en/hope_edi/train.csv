For example

1,This is ridiculous.  No one can have an open and free debate and discussion.   To say all lives matter is perfectly reasonable yet is met with derision.   All white politicians are in fear and terror.

1,I just hear insecurities being voiced. Not a single legit complain in this video. Men deal with the same stuff
0,@Amazing Worenwu all lives means we are all equal
0,+Ancient Soul oh Lord. I don't think you'll ever understand. There's a specific context in which the black lives matter movement arose. Because black people were being killed and there were multiple incidents of the same type of thing. What exactly is the context for the all lives matter movement and focusing on the whole world? It was only created as a combatant otherwise it wouldn't even exist. No one is blaming white people. We're saying stop killing black people unjustly. That's it. Obviously there are other problems going. Probably more important ones too. But are people not allowed to stand up for themselves without being attacked? Would you not like to be able to stand up for yourself without being opposed? That's all this is about but sadly I don't think you'll be able to understand no matter which way I put it

1,@Teehee hi First off
1,@Jamie Ryan Storey i think Madonna holds a bigger grudge than Cyndi does on her.  Cyndi always speaks highly of Madonna and i find it odd (again) almost every interview with Cyndi .. Madonna is brought up in the conversation .. but with Madonna interviews; no mention of Cyndi.  One thing that would be difficult to accomplish with both them in the same room working on a project; discipline.  Madonna IS very disciplined.  Cyndi is scattered.  But both are very creative and passionate about their work.  Definitely two worlds colliding.
1,I also thought that  but in the end

1,It‚Äôs ashamed that you were met with ridicule after saying ‚ÄúAll lives matter‚Äù.  I don‚Äôt agree with trashing someone who may not understand the cause. In short saying ‚Äú All lives matter‚Äù in response to ‚ÄúBlack lives matter‚Äù can come off as dismissive and purposefully missing the point. BLM at its core is not meant to divide or ridicule but to bring awareness. Hopefully your conversations on the subject (should you continue to have one) end with more acceptance and understanding rather than anger and insults. Best of luck

1,peter gunn yeah if you wanna come I am always ready to take you around
1,All lives matter doesn‚Äôt make no logical sense because it‚Äôs white people who are suffering. BLM is like saying Black Lives matter too. It‚Äôs not saying Only Black Lives Matter. Too say all lives matter or white lives matter isn‚Äôt rational and of course you are gonna get booed. It‚Äôs because white people are being killed by the police for no reason. White people arent being discriminated against. White people got it made. Not all white people but the majority of America is white people. And not even 100 years ago my grandpa couldn‚Äôt use the same restrooms as white people. So saying all lives matter is like a chicken protesting against the wolf and the wolf saying their life matters too. Of course it does. But it‚Äôs not what the movement is about. So please shut up when you say all lives matter. No matter what you mean by it.
1,Truth hurts. BLM just can't handle the Truth!

0,That's probably because they're still in the closet due to their christian brainwashing from their church. It happens a lot in Christian communities. Usually when they start to live outside that community then theh might just might come out. I grew up in a Christian community so I say this from seeing my LGBTQ friends come out not until their early 20s or even later. I love them all which is one of the many reasons why I am not Christian anymore. The churches thinking they have the right to judge. Check yourselves Christians read Romans 1

1,#BlackLivesMatter isnt about being better than other races its about making people aware of what black people go through that other groups don't. If white people where constantly being discriminated against they would actually have a reason to say whitelivesmatter. All lives matter makes people feel like it's is just there to downgrade what Blacklivesmatter really stands for.
0,@t0bias busterud You are missing my point. I find it impossible to understand that a movement that is trying to redress inequality has a main banner statement  of inequality. I am not putting the importance of any race over any other. The statement White Lives Matter is just as wrong as Black Lives Matter. I am sure the movement has some valid points but the cause is not helped by a provocative banner. All Lives Matter would be perfect for the movement because it wouldn't diminish the impact and it would show absolute unity and equal opportunity for everyone going forward. I believe this would garner additional support from all areas of all communities.
1,Kudos to Wired for not trying to stifle and censor discussion although I had to check to see if I accidentally clicked on a Buzzfeed link. The beauty of all STEM fields is the objectivity in deciding who is most qualified for a job. Listening to the ladies speak I got no sense of an actual systemic issue in the field but more that they are just insecure about  themselves and how they interact with colleagues.

You don't care about lives lost.  Liars. You don't care about racism. Nonsense. You're not in a battle for civil rights. You're liars who treat an entire race like they are children.

1,@SepherStar Well I would partly disagree. Even train drivers in the US are known as engineers as apart from driving train engines they are expected to know the nitty gritties of their engines as well as troubleshoot engine problems when in operation. What I meant by working with hands (exaggeration) was that skilled engineers are more hands-on with practical experience on shop floor or on site in case of projects. This is precisely why women are misfits in a field like engineering cuz they are dependent mostly on technicians and do not like to take orders from their managers (submissive attitude) due to ego problems. (Managers would rarely shout orders to female sub-ordinates lest they get sued for sexual harassment... so instead of giving orders to their female sub-ordinates

1,Joannot Fampionona You are not seeing the problem. These women engineers are saying only women get questioned when they are new which isn't true. Every new engineer has gotten the look for the experienced ones but this is another feminist excuse to cry racism
1,Ramon Murray Holy fuck I never said capitalism is a system of ethics. I said that in reply to a previous comment trying to justify sexism with capitalism i.e. just because it's what happens doesn't mean it's the right thing.nnAnd I'm talking about physical abilities because that was the excuse given to me (read my previous comment) when I was declined a hangar rec. They told me they would prefer men since a lot of climbing is involved. I was talking about physical abilities because a previous comment told me men are biologically stronger

I have a classmate who is bisexual (it‚Äôs a girl) and she absolutely loves girls but she can‚Äôt be in an open relationship because her parents would despise her if they ever found out. Being against someone who is LGBT is basically being against people‚Äôs existence and everyone has the right to live their lives as they see fit.

1,is this iraq???
1,The elephant in the room just needs to be mentioned. When we say Black Lives Matter a lot of people don‚Äôt understand what it really means so they call it racist.  I Know people that are white and Hispanic that held up the sign during the George Floyd protest. The reason why they did this was not  because they wanted to be black But  because they knew what it meant . In short it means that we matter  to but we feel like people that aren‚Äôt our color in general don‚Äôt recognize that we do. We know all lives matter everybody should know that. God loves us all but we don‚Äôt love us all.

1,Panji Rizki the term homophobic has a historical relationship with the AIDS epidemic. Fear of LGBTQ can be based on or surrounded by fear of HIV/AIDS during the last century. I‚Äôm not sure anyone who disagrees with your faith would associate that with any malady. Though
1,I think in general we all get along pretty well. Even with some democrats.
1,I really love this interview. All the pretension is gone. No phony accent. No self-inflation. Just insightful reflection and real humility.
1,I love the end
1,Jessica Walker that‚Äôs because a lot of Christians try to force their religions down others‚Äô throats. Why should I respect someone for their beliefs when they can‚Äôt even respect mine?
1,If you can‚Äôt say all lives matter then your racist. But the new norm is black lives matter only. Absolutely ridiculous what white people have to deal with.

1,How about only Christian lives matter.nThat's what I think but I dont go around saying it because it would give Christians a bad name. Jesus wants everyone to worship him. I will never understand why anyone wouldn't.

1,this all a publicity stunt from the dems
1,@Mr. carpenter bee maybe I should have used the word indoctrinate not brainwashed. nobody forces an adolescent to believe in a religion but they are more prone to believing certain views if they grew up with that religion being the norm. But if they leave that community and are able to think outside that norm then they might question several aspects but when someone is under a certain age they just go with the flow of their communities norms unless it causes them pain. There have been many LGBTQ youth in religious communities who are shunned when they come out. Just think of the implications and pressures someone has to go through when their community does not accept them. in my opinion
1,AKA conversion torture
1,@Luke B Ah did not know about Pride wanting to have no police company outside of their participants. Still that should have nothing to do with option for Pride to call police for help.nnStill sounds silly. Police in first place should be conscious about enforcing law both on citizens and within themselve.nThat is what I am paying taxes for. Not for them to prance around doing nothing but looking good.nThat is different business called Modelling.

0,I just want to point out that the Bible does not say that homosexuality is a sin. The passage that I‚Äôve always seen sited has been proven to be translated incorrectly and is actually condemning pedophilia rather than homosexuality. ‚ÄúMen shall not lay with man‚Äù was originally meant to read as ‚Äúman shall not lay with boy‚Äù. Homosexuality is never condemned. Please do research and learn about the origins of the book you claim to worship. Incorrect translations and interpretation of God‚Äôs words are harming real people on a daily basis.

1,Isn't the majority of killings of Black lives in America actually by other black individuals?   I highly value Black lives I have traveled to Nigeria twice and to Rwanda twice to teach workshops on how to save newborn babies at birth.  These babies happen to be Black and I have worked in hospitals to save people of all races.   My understanding is there are a whole lot more black lives lost though in the United States due to Violence among the Afro American community in impoverished neighborhoods.   To focus on the police as a critical solution to the loss of Black lives and to take actions that are not precisely calibrated will result in a great increase in the loss of Black lives.   The police have been serving the Black community.   Yes there have been incidences of abuse by police just as there have been nurses that purposefully killed their patients but we don't decide to get rid of nurses because of these few  crazy ones.   After all Black lives matter right?

1,@WOW Thank you for that helpful comparison.  The problem inherent in this situation arises when the BLM movement embodies radical principles that threaten the lives of other groups or lawful systems.r  The movement's dynamic shifts from peacefully calling attention to the oppression of the black race to radically lashing out with violence or hate speech under a logic process that can be summed up as two wrongs make us right.

1,Daiyan Farrel Keigo Hartono BLM are protesting across Europe and the UK...it‚Äôs not just the USA these protests are occurring.   One of my points is for the BLM spokespersons to look at the big picture and give a voice to modern day slaves who are currently bought and sold from within the African continent.  Asian people are employed under false pretences of employment and forced into the sex trade or slave labour.  So rather than wasting all that energy looting and ripping statues down why don‚Äôt BLM focus and protest on something that‚Äôs happening right now.  Pulling a statue down achieves nothing!
1,ImAlfie I agree! But I don‚Äôt think anyone made her say that. What if she actually believes in the Bible maybe?üßê

0,@NOXISUM you really couldn't have been more racist with that comment. I'm African American and I support the all lives matter statement. You sit there and say white people make it about them. Uhhh no it's not just white people its every other non black race and they're not trying to bash this protest. But why can't it just be about police brutality and racism in general. Black people and white people get hated on all the time and that goes the same for Asians and Hispanics. The all lives matter thing is saying police brutality needs to end and so does racism. And do you really think black people aren't racist against white people. I just saw a video of a group of black people beating the sh!t out of white people and setting their cars on fire. Like what kinda response is that. It seems like you think only black people know struggle racially or otherwise and that's just not true.

1,Hepo Slis I don‚Äôt understand a word u just said
0,For people who were judging Annie (and I read that she has come out now but I'm not sure if that's true) I was the same way when I was younger because I grew up in a religious family. But I was really really confused and hated myself because I couldn't understand why God would hate me if I like girls. Which for me made me try to prove even more that I didn't like girls at all. I finally left the religion two years ago and came out as bisexual. It's really scary if your family is homophobic and tell you that you are damned forever for that...

1,For you thickheaded folks that don‚Äôt seem to understand what BLM means... it DOES NOT mean that the lives of other races don‚Äôt matter or don‚Äôt matter as much. It is a response to America showing us that Black lives have not mattered equally to other lives. BLM is simply a reminder that
1,@Jake Harrison That's your opinion man.
1,If we went back in time ....?.....Time only repeats itself at one point ..and...if not for time ....the.further is a null.

1,@Average Murican statistics wise yes more White people are killed by Cops then black people.   But Also Statistics Wise more (Unarmed) Black people are killed by Cops there's a Difference.   Also Anyone Who has a Counter Protest like All Lives Matter are a Racist or Bigot because they don't care how many (Unarmed) (unjustly) Black people are being killed so once White privilege is Taken away ND White Supremacy we will have peace.

1,@Bailee Beckett In fact
1,@Dirieh Ngongo Black lives mattered since the civil rights act was passed in 1964. Everyone knows black lives matter in the modern day and age. But you cannot shy away from the fact that there are and always will be individual racists by constructing a movement that is completely counterproductive to the African American community. Blaming it on factors such as systematic racism that clearly doesn't exist for black people. Let's take college acceptance for example. A black candidate for being a student in the school premise is more sawn after than a person of yellow colour with the same qualifications. Now tell me how you guys have it worse that isn't of your own doing. By creating this victim mentality you literally take all hope away from them with the lies you radicals have created.
1,BLM is indeed an organization who has their own beliefs and stand for different things. But BLM is a statement or phrase that stands for the fact that black lives matter too. Please don‚Äôt take our phrase and try to make it political. It‚Äôs not some political agenda. It is used to signal black empowerment. We don‚Äôt all agree on the political side of the BLM organization

0,@S. Tagerius I was really impressed with your ability to communicate the horrific implications of conversion therapy and support of the LGBT+ community.. but completely shocked and disappointed that you are advocating that abortion is killing a baby. Why is it that you think LGBT+ individuals are worthy of bodily autonomy but women aren't worthy of having autonomy over their bodies??
1,@Melissa Rose No one. It's a fictional story. They didn't exist.
1,not gonna lie... sounds like a horse race. All lives matter no matter who you are
0,Some of the black lives matter people are doing things correctly to protect their people but there are some that are destructive against innocent people and bad people too.When someone says black lives matter it is rude to say all lives matter because the purpose of this movement is black protection for their people and it‚Äôs rude to bring other lives to erase its main purpose.Its like saying ‚ÄúMy cousin died help me‚Äùthen person two replying who cares mine died too.Respecting personal rights means world peace .

Also maybe to get back at mommy and daddy for some trinket or such that the kid wanted. When they didn't get it they joined the BLM movement. Same as those celebs from Holkyweird cause it's the newest thing to spend their money on so they can feel good about helping some poor kids starving. nThey don't realize the devil has a grip on their souls.

1,@Lauren Ray they are right
1,@TheLegend27 Is Alive you do realize we sin everyday right? Let people have there own beliefs
1,Obviously white lives matter but you‚Äôre missing the point. That‚Äôs like saying when there‚Äôs kids being killed left and right and someone starts a ‚ÄúKids love matters‚Äù movement. Saying ‚ÄúAll live matters‚Äù or ‚ÄúAdult lives matter‚Äù is undermining the message. Obviously all lives matter. But it‚Äôs not black lives matter and not anyone else. They are saying their lives also matter.
1,The democratis are basically saying that they don‚Äôt matter

At the very least they could have called it black lives matter too at least that indicates to some degree that you give a shit about other people other than your own kind.  I swear you need to think when trying to start a movement like this.

1,Hai Huynh I do do research and that does happen. I feel like you‚Äôre only looking at black people who are getting killed and dismissing the other races that are also getting killing in the same way. Have you seen the videos about random bricks being left in the middle of protests? Or how there are triangle holes being left in glass windows where riots and looters happen. There‚Äôs under cover stuff going on. Blm is pretty much like a cover up for an agenda to take place. It‚Äôs making people have hate in their hearts and causing destruction. That movement isn‚Äôt helping anything at all but only making the left come up with up ways to continue salving people who are black.

1,Do you not see how saying all lives matter gaslights and undermines blm? You need to understand when someone says blm they are not saying other lives don‚Äôt matter they are saying black lives matter too. Blm just wants people to treat black people equally not above or below.

1,WHAT EVERY ONE FORGETS IS THAT THE STATUE IS THERE FOR THE WORK HE DID nFOR THE POOR. by this measure we have to pull down every statue that pren dates 1833 in England. the other point id like to raise is that it is nlikely that roughly 99% of ppl in the crowd are wearing or carrying somen thing made in a sweat shop there fore are using modern slavery. This isn just mob stupidity i bet a large proportion of ppl didn't even know then name of the guy on the statue as it fell. i believe the world should ben a meritocracy where people are just people and not labeled by arbitraryn factors.

0,kris c where in the Bible does it say that homosexuality is a sin? The passage that I‚Äôve always seen sited has been proven to be translated incorrectly and is actually condemning pedophilia rather than homosexuality. ‚ÄúMan shall not lay with man‚Äù was originally meant to read as ‚Äúman shall not lay with boy‚Äù. Homosexuality is never condemned. Please do research and learn about the origins of the book you claim to worship.

1,OMG sounds like a bunch of unattractive women whining.
1,God did NOT create the human races
1,Very reasonable and well thought out. I agree and further more can add that a number such as the ratio of men to women in engineering fields does not show there is a problem. Rather this demonstrates that despite a  level playing field women as a whole don't want to be or may dream about it but are not willing to put in the work as frequently as men are. I was listening to a consultant for law firms talk about female lawyers and the legal field has a hard time hanging on to female partners after 30 years old. This iss not based on their skills because they will have earned their place

1,The problem is that there is no way to reasonably or logically argue against LGBTQ without saying the word god.  The separation of church and state is a thing.  The problem we have with Christians is that they are trying to legislate the rules of their religion into law and putting religion above people in disowning and/or kicking out their kids or other family members for being LGBTQ.

1,only all lives matter nobody cares what black lives matters have to say about that all lives matters and always will and the truth is BLM won't be paid attention to again here in about a year because all lives matter need to go ahead and get together and start their Rally's  to with their t-shirts and I was wondering when the next all lives matter March will get together.

I've started engineering projects this year and they have been well received by all (boys and girls).nnIn reply to the comment about men not being in elementary Ed. I don't see men as not being encouraged to be teachers. There is no culture saying men aren't smart enough to be teachers. However it seems girls may think they are not smart enough. A lot of it is misconceptions about what engineers are and do.nnIn response to the victim comment. She is being an example for young girls that even if you are told you can't do something you should try again and not give up. Teaching young girls to persevere and work hard is not a bad thing.

1,Jeff Davis statistically white people are born in a better economic situation than most black ppl. We also have a higher median income than the black community in every class. Black ppl also have a much lower chance of being accepted for a traditional mortgage.

I‚Äôm sure there are more examples of systemic racism but I‚Äôd have to research more. I hope this changes ur view.

You guys realise that we aren't saying other races don't matter we are just pointing out that black people are getting killed for their skin colour. Of course everyone matters but wth like are we really gonna focus on a dumb thing like this when black people are getting killed for their skin colour. Unbelievable

0,My parents gave my brother all the next latest and greatest electronics that were coming out during early 2000s and they use to give me all the pretty dolls and role play toys typical for girls. nThey thought he was going to be a programmer cuz he played a lot of computer games but he decided to major in art and I majored in computer science lol! I didn't even know I liked programming until I took an intro cs course during my senior year of high school. nI always knew I had kind of an engineering mentality growing up because I liked taking scraps from the recycling bin and building random things from it. I even made houses for my dolls and ignored the store bought doll house my parents gave to me for my birthday.nThis really inspires and reassures me that I'm making the right choices for my path. I might even consider after i complete my computer science degree to go pursue engineering as well.

0,Y‚Äôall really need to let go. Yes we know all lives matter. That‚Äôs a given. But the reason why people have to say black lives matter ‚Äútoo‚Äù is because black lives have it mattered since the 1800s!!! We know like white lives matter that has been proven that white lives matter over all of her lives in America time and time and time and time and time and time and time and time and time and time again. Nobody has ever questioned if all lives matter. So that part of the conversation is over with and irrelevant. Now let‚Äôs concentrate on the lives that have not mattered in America. Please concentrate and focus on what needs to be done to help. Don‚Äôt concentrate on what needs to be done to perpetuate the current paradigm. It is time for a change. All lies has always mattered and white lives has mattered above all in black lives has mattered the least in America. Stay focused people..

1,George FIoyd held a preg Woman at gunpoint in 2007. George Floyd was the trigger but black lives matter is not about him. There were many Georges before him and there will be a lot more killed by cops until the killing ends. It sucks that the black person that triggered all this was an actual criminal ... we have to look beyond just one bad man and focus on the message
1,It‚Äôs stupid to say All Lives Matter because we already know.
0,The truth is All lives matter
1,The reply from the Sheriff was
0,She doesn't sound like a victim to me. She sounds like an engineer. I tried this. It didn't work so I tried that. I figured out this. Then I tried that. It worked.
1,It's a tricky and divisive campaign. And that's what it is.
1,For ages I thought BLM was a type of sandwich.
1,BLM = COMMUNIST .
1,@cricket_price  agreed

1,Eagle you‚Äôre starting to dislike black people more because of a movement that WHITE people started I hope you realize that
1,Hydross 77 are you agreeing that blm matters before alm? or...
0,I'm sorry to say this but I don't think that she can do very much in order to inspire girls to become engineers with her product as it still heavily relies on the parents buying them. I believe that the real issue isn't getting girls interested in engineering but rather to prevent parents from pushing their kids into stereotypical roles because I think that the families that buy Miss Sterling's books are the same that would have also gotten their girls a variety of toys
1,I have to agree
1,Why? Because the world became a sad sad place full of snowflakes who get offended by literarly anything.
1,Does the short haired girl have like insta or something

1,D D I think because it‚Äôs more of you in the US
1,Let me tell you what
1,Mike F. Yes child prostitution is awful but quite frankly is unrelated to the topic of racism against the black community. I honestly don‚Äôt understand what point you were trying to make here. Are you suggesting racism isn‚Äôt an issue and people should stop whinging?
1,Will people PLEASE STOP pulling down public toilets for sea gulls
1,The news media insights the riots and hatred.
1,I guess they forgot to talk what's happening in seattle
1,Sooooooo brown lives dnt matter?
1,Btw don't apologize for offending anyone. Not saying whatever you want and holding back leads to suppression of speech which eventually leads to tyranny in short. Not many people know about why America was born . Yes they were slave owners but tell me one person in this country whos ancestors weren't owned from 3000 or more years ago till now. We all have been slaves. We are all still slaves to the monetary system really. We're still here fighting each other about color when there's a bigger picture just behind the lies you see everyday

1,Well someone is in deniel of their sexuality. Just saying ‚Äç

1,It's never a good idea to make a political statement on YouTube
1,They could notify Bristol councillor Mark Weston and he could dive in and retrieve it and have it melted down and turned into a statue of Bristolian Isambard Kingdom Brunel...far more worthy

1,Sea Doggo well stereotypes exist for a reason. they do have some truth in them
1,@Molly Rebekah You seem bit annoyed with me. That's not very Christ like ü§≠.

1,@Molly Rebekah It's fine if you believe in him. But to make definite statements of his existence and expecting them to hold up as a counter point is foolish.
1,@Vanesa Criminal like you who is spreading hate on the YouTube comment section
1,From listening to them speak about their experiences I feel like most of them are externalising internal fears and prejudices they feel should exist and hold themselves back rather than there being some pervasive and rampant problem. Fewer women than men comprise the workforce but what is the percentage of women that study these fields and what is the percentage of women that actively search for a job in those fields?nnThis is a fairly emotional study of a few women that seem to have grown up with a belief that a bias existed and still does. This isn't a level headed representation of the industry today and leads to nothing but personal speculation. Completely pointless.
1,BLM is procrime and just ridiculous.
1,It‚Äôs actually rehabilitation just like an addict they under go rehabilitation
0,I don‚Äôt really understand the idea of people assuming people‚Äôs sexuality based on their appearance. Like we are fighting against stereotypes but still are using stereotypes.

1,Because the channel is ‚Äúwoke‚Äù
1,@Xean Frost you just compared hundreds upon hundreds of years of oppression with a minor inconvenience. please open up your mind and see how life is for people. just because you lack melanin doesn't inherently mean you lack compassion
1,By saying only black lives matter enough times
1,@Pamela Frances That is the point I am trying to make. These people feel ire against a statue yet continue to live in a city which prospered during the slave trade. There are two options for them

1,@Hai Huynh  One thing that is left out and never clarified is the behavior of the person who is being sought by the police. Why is it a justification for that person to run or get away from the cops or do other things that will escalate the matter? You think it's OK to do things like that to the police? Does this give them cause to disobey and we should just let them off free just because they're black and their lives matter?  It's thoughts like these that have criminals getting out of jail and running free to continue doing crimes because dumb people think it's OK. Then when these criminals go out and hurt others

1,@h5b12345 The point of her saying that she did not fit in was not because she's saying that she didn't have friends or that she was shunned. She did repeat the statement I do not fit in multiple times but that was for effect. It is called repetition for effect. But what she was trying to say was that she did not fit in because she was in a room full of OTHER MEN. That's the whole point of this TED Talk. She's not blaming on the lack of skills to become an engineer but rather pointing out a flaw in the societal view on gender norms here in the United States and the impact this has on kids and their decisions in the future. As a current mechanical engineer at the NYU School of Engineering

Red black white yellow we are all human beings.
0,I'm lesbian and one thing that bothers me is when supporters of LGBTQ get all mad when some people dont agree with us and call that homophobic.

Especially personally this week because I have dealt my whole college life with doubters and disbelievers in my intelligence and diligence & to realize I'm not alone in feeling alone was very awakening and motivating. I'm so inspired to inspire young females to dare to challenge societal pressures and expectations and open the minds of the close minded. An engineer once asked me what it was like to be in a mans world and I replied with I'm used to it and it's not a mans world

1,The intention of Auschwitz is a museum to remember the terrible acts committed within it. The statue was a celebration and glorification of Colston. The statue should have been moved to a museum and both his philanthropy and slave trading mentioned alongside it.
1,I‚Äôll be honest i live in Scotland so I believe the racism is not noticed as much here as everywhere else around the world.

They might struggle doing manual labor such as using a jack-hammer but mentally the are equal to males. Its just the way kids are programed. Most parents don't even do it intentionally but¬†each gender is programed to do certain things so by the time they grow up they are on auto pilot. They can't tell you why they like doing this or that because they were program to do certain jobs while they were young. That's why each gender tend to do certain job.nnIts takes guts to say NO!

1,@Eugene Birukov they are not saying black lives matter more.  They simply want black lives to matter equally.   You cannot argue that they matter equally right now.
1,if they want a divide then keep destroying the history
0,when someone says ‚Äúi dont agree with homosexuality‚Äù is like hating people who are left handed
1,@connie schuiling What the he do you think is going on right now. We are using Americans as guinea pigs. Trump is willing to risk any amount of lives to get a vaccine on the market before the election. Unless the CDC slows his dumbass down many Americans might die.

1,@tadhg scanlon and statistically black people suffer from abortion more than white people do. And statistically black families 70% of them have father absentee rate. But then again so are a lot of white people. It's a cultural thing we live in a free country where everybody has equal opportunity to dig themselves out of where they're at and make something of themselves. I suggest you start watching some Candace Owens
1,She still comes off entitled
1,He means because god made the girl and the boy for something
1,@UCcJ1GJwW-6qgQgOIKxBalEQ i know what it can mean but most people using the term 'allliveematter' are using it not as a protest but as a way for equality

1,WHY CLINTON IS NOT UNDER CONTROL? SHE IS N TRIAL THE F SHE IS ON TV?
1,People keep talking about the rioting and looting
1,the point of the outrage over that star is because that allows you to completely ignore how Hillary is the most corrupt candidate in history and instead of talking about that talk about how awful Trump is because he didn't have people look at it and try and decide is there any way this could be construed as racist or anti-semitic or in some way make Trump look bad pointing out Hillary is crooked
1,So the MS Paint shapes are becoming racist...nnNot surprised
1,Black lives Matter around the world!

1,k k who's annie
1,@James Johnson¬†??? but are you claiming that women are just as strong as men? When men could do it much better
0,It‚Äôs a fact but it‚Äôs not the case at this time. We don‚Äôt have oppression at such a large scale by ‚Äòall races‚Äô. There are problems in the black community that needs to be fixed at this very moment. Of course all lives matter but saying all lives matter against black lives matter is like math. You have a problem you need to solve so you solve one problem at the time
1,+E = MC HAMMER so that makes the murder of the black men acceptable? if some guy gets revenge then it's fine if a cop kills someone? your logic is not consistent.
1,Why? Because some internet people will dislike a video about sexism in work places (including tech industry)?nIt's crazy

1,Thays because right now thats the thing that matters the most.
1,#NAME?
1,Neo-Blshevism in full effect.
1,@Michael Paysour to cut wages and work hours because of it people dont realise that stuff costs money like that socialist Bernie sander who doesn't understand that free college is not even a thing because the only way to support it is by taxes and people who save money and work 2 jobs to pay for their children's college and their is people who waste money instead of saving for their debt. In reality obama was not a great president and he was only praised because he was black his affordable health care just made the majority of people to pay for others and had 50% rise you are just proving the point that democrats want the black vote that is really only worth 15% of the American population
1,Because that never happened? People just like to brand cop killers as BLM after the fact to set up a false narrative. None of the killers had any ties to BLM besides being black.

1,Why? Because black people are racist.
1,@Mark Slima hes got another 4 years in the bag already because of idiots like you thanks. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN
1,MB G black lives haven‚Äôt mattered since they were enslaved and brought to this country. Police brutality is big issue that many people of color deal with. Too many black lives have been lost by the hands of police. No to little reform have been made to help this issue

1,I'm personally against- well not against; i guess just not for- homosexuality
1,Inspiration is good
1,@Jamie Ryan Storey i think Madonna holds a bigger grudge than Cyndi does on her.  Cyndi always speaks highly of Madonna and i find it odd (again) almost every interview with Cyndi .. Madonna is brought up in the conversation .. but with Madonna interviews; no mention of Cyndi.  One thing that would be difficult to accomplish with both them in the same room working on a project; discipline.  Madonna IS very disciplined.  Cyndi is scattered.  But both are very creative and passionate about their work.  Definitely two worlds colliding.
1,@Molly Rebekah i really dont understand here
1,SHERIFF DAVID CLARK and LARRY ELDERS are typical of Most BLACK Americans in this Country
0,I don‚Äôt think testing school kids on science is really indicative of STEM aptitude. Girls brains develop faster and they are typically better students early on. Also

1,Maggie Paul but if people say all lives matter it gets back lash ?
1,YuhakushoWeebtard but black lives matter has a cause. Black people are being shot and killed by cops and it‚Äôs wrong. There‚Äôs no current reason rn because if anything racist small minded people already believe that they are above black people which they are not. So it‚Äôs just a snarky and irrelevant comeback for a real problem.

1,The Black Sheriff IS AWESOME!!
1,@Kansuke Nelson The majority of African Americans do not agree with BLM because first off
1,I agree with everything said here about how weird it is for all lives matter to be controversial. I would like to say though that we must not become like the Democrats as I found it a bit disrespectful for the sherriff to be interrupting when the man who was talking was making his point.
1,Floyd killed in a democrats' turf to cause blame on Trump administration
1,jo ma straight people be trippin
1,Can we get an extended version of Marcus & Jules?
1,Yeah  like all lives matter is equality.
0,sara leong I love science as well!!! But it is extremely hard for me to focus in math. Mainly because (probably because of classes arrangements) I am one of the only three girls in my math class of 12 and almost all the boys didn't know what staying on topic meant. They would yell and chat loudly. The teacher just seems to not hear them (probably because she has learned that it gave her less headaches). Anyways I love legos as well! I hope there's more people like you and your family in the world!!!

1,Yes and it should of been sprayed all over the protestors and let them pay for there own hospital care
1,Please have this sheriff for the next black president
1,Yes - it would probably help if the government hadn't just killed 50 000 people.
1,Personally I do not have an exact conclusion of if there is or there is a lack of a god. I feel like religions have their standpoint on how they want to look at life and I think that aethiests have a separate way to look at our existence

1,Because there are MORE lives that matter and the last I checked saying all lives matter excludes NOBODY. But the devil is in the details and the Democrats are demons and they have done nothing to help the black community! I USED to be a Democrat until I did my own research and stopped listening to these BIASED DNC controlled media outlets. These are the times of REVELATIONS!!

0,We are missing the best female talent. There may be females that are truly interested but not encouraged (as in told about engineering not forced) or bullied out of it (there have been studies that show capable females leave STEM because they are bullied by peers or faculty). I do not force anyone into a field they are not interested in - I have a cousin that would be capable but not interested. I tell her to do what she likes. But there are females that would like it - we need to find them. A diverse workforce makes it a better workforce. Crash tests were only conducted using males dummies until females engineers got involved and saw there needed to be tests on females as well! Females and males do approach problems in different ways

1,I say all lives matter because I believe racism against any race is wrong.
1,That sheriff is just as right today as he was 4 years ago.
1,Saying all lives matter is not a problem but treating all lives with the same respect is the problem and if that is not happening then it's clear that all lives don't matter you can't go around as a police killing black people and on the other hand arresting white people clearly all lives doesn't  matter
1,That video clip should be posted online under a definition of 'Pandering'.   The Irish guy is the only one who meant what he said.

1,If you don‚Äôt like what someone is saying
1,Black panthers and last poets were anti-gay. So was Malcolm X. nBlack Lives Matter movement is against the nuclear family and they are pro-marxist as they admit this on their website. This isn't a black movement... it's an LGBTQ movement for gays & pro-welfare state agenda disguised as a black movement. nnBLM remained quiet during the shootings on fathers day where over 100 black on black killings took place. The reason they didn't address it is because they didn't want to bring focus to fathers day as it would go against their beliefs.
1,All lives matter you sickening liberals !! Except maybe for the lives of violent criminals

1,Cuffed jeans are fashion statement
1,@Charter Jet Affiliate the police in general do believe that. Don't listen to the news media villify them. A few bad eggs don't make the whole police force dangerous. The police are responsible for keeping civility in this country. The minute they are made a non-factor chaos and anarchy ensues.
0,Remember what Martin Luther King Jr said that every body should be treated equally. So black people can‚Äôt even listen to there own race with out even saying BLM. Because if Blacks mattered and whites didn‚Äôt then we aren‚Äôt treated equally. Cut the BS and help our future crisis for GD!

1,@pepsi Atlas I'm white and proud of my ancestors and my skin colour!! Does that make me a racist!!?
0,Saying All lives matter can be offensive for the same reason black lives matter can be offensive to some. Black Lives Matter is an offensive saying because to some¬†¬†it insinuates that the majority of non blacks think that black lives don't matter and that the majority of non blacks are racist when there is absolutely¬†no physical evidence to support that thought. So obviously¬†to a non racist non black that¬†is a grossly¬†offensive notion. Now All Lives Matter can be offensive to some blacks because¬†to them¬†it insinuates that they¬†only care about black lives and that they're saying other lives don't matter when if you¬†actually try¬†comprehend their perspective
1,@Jimmy The Clown
1,@Sweet_Luna Bae shut up snowflake. You don't live in Africa
1,@Khaver Paver The reason you won't go back to Africa is because you would be lost without your white American master giving you handouts in the form of welfare and you'd miss malt liquor and using your race card at every chance you get.

1,I find the discrimination of every kind horrendous and Nazi
1,@Nataliah Griffin how is Greek Mythology Witchcraft ?
1,People say Black lives Matter becasue it is obvious that many Americans think they don't matter.  The slogan does not day Only Black lives mattter.  Saying all lives matter is a way to avoid saying that Black lives matter.  It has been adopted by racists around the country.  400 years of history (which many refuse to acknowledge) prove that black lives do not matter to many Americans.
1,You see the reason for the saying black lives matter is too raise awareness of how many black people are victims of oppression. A better way to put it is Black Lives Matters Too. So when people say all lives matter it is a true statement but contradicts Black Lives Matter.
1,Look at this offended black boy

There will always be those in the world that do not see the person for the special person that they are. It isn't right. I just have to believe that those who promote hate through discrimination will answer for it when they stand before God.

0,The sad thing is this is the least abusive conversion therapy I've ever heard of. My friends have scars and burns where they were shocked and burned and tortured.

1,The Catholic priests say otherwise. She's not mother Teresa who actually lived in poverty even though she won 1.5 million with a novel priest prize and really saved lives and souls. Madonna is a woman who lives for herself and had two abortions. nShe's a rich performer with a messed up life and she is not a role model. Take what you can but beware. Eventually she will poison you.
1,Hope is for the ones who love God. Good is evil. Madonna will turn to Christ before she dies and get saved and for this blessing i ask in the holy name of Jesus Christ! Amen.
