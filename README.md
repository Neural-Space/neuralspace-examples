# NeuralSpace Examples
In this repo you will find various datasets, scripts, etc. that will help you understand our APIs better and faster.

## Datasets

### Natural Language Understanding (NLU)
We formatted various openly available NLU datasets so that they can be directly used on our platform.
These datasets can be found in the `datasets/nlu` folder. 
There are different sub-folders for different languages.


# Note

NeuralSpace does not own any rights to these datasets and these are not for commercial use. 
Licenses of each of these datasets will be added here soon.
